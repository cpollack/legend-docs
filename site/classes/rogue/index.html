<p>No two rogues are quite the same, and some can show quite incredible variety. Whether by nature or nurture, rogues develop a wide range of talents, though any given rogue has a preference for certain aspects of that spectrum. These unorthodox fighting styles make rogues dangerous and unpredictable opponents, and they often relish in their enemies' confusion. A rogue's vast arsenal of tricks means they can keep their enemies guessing until the final blow. Some rogues like to make elaborate plans, depending on personal skill and expertise; others play it fast and loose, relying on their luck when everything goes sour. </p>
<h1 id="party-role">Party Role</h1>
<p>Rogues are excellent at dealing lots of damage while remaining mobile. A rogue should always be on the lookout for her next target, and deliver devastating blows where they count most. As a class that trains many skills, rogues are versatile characters both in and out of combat. </p>
<h1 id="rogues-in-your-game">Rogues in Your Game</h1>
<p>While it might be tempting to make all rogues some kind of thief, they can also serve as excellent scouts, pirates, musketeers, duelists, or undercover detectives. A rogue's many skills make them excellent experts of almost any profession.</p>

<h1 id="class-features">Class Features</h1>
<h3 id="technician-or-warrior">Technician or Warrior</h3>
<p>Rogues are either unsurpassed experts in skills or able combatants. At 1st level, a rogue chooses between either a Good Base Attack Bonus (equal to level) or 2 additional trained skills (bringing their base number of trained skills to 8). This choice is permanent. </p>
<h3 id="hardy-or-resolute">Hardy or Resolute</h3>
<p>In addition, rogues can choose between being slippery tricksters or hardy thugs. Choose one of Will or Fortitude; that save is a Good save for you, and the other is Poor. Reflex is always a Good save for rogues. This choice is permanent.</p>
<h3 id="rogue-tactics">Rogue Tactics</h3>
<p>Each rogue chooses a single track's worth of offensive class features and a single track's worth of defensive class features. You choose both your offensive and defensive track at 1st level. Once made, these choices are permanent. Unless stated otherwise, rogue abilities are extraordinary and can be used at will.</p>
<p>The variety inherent to these tracks means that rogues vary in their Key Ability Modifiers. Your choice of offensive track determines your Key Offensive Modifier, and your choice of defensive track determines your Key Defensive Modifier. If you multiclass out of one of these tracks, you may choose any ability modifier for the KOM (for rogues without an offensive track) or KDM (for rogues without a defensive track); of course, the two modifiers must still be linked to different abilities. </p>
<h3 id="the-gift">The Gift</h3>
<p>While rogues can choose different offensive and defensive tracks, there is a certain essence that defines a rogue. Either they are masters of their craft, or sly rogues that seem to be making it up as they go along. A rogue must choose between the Esoterica Radica and the Esoterica Adeptus. This choice is permanent. These paths are unique to Rogues and cannot be traded away via multiclassing (or accessed via multiclassing).</p>
<h1 id="offensive-track">Offensive Track</h1>
<p>Pick one of the following tracks. You gain the abilities of your chosen track in order, at the level shown in the table for your class.</p>
<h2 id="assassin">Assassin</h2>
<p>Rogues who choose the Assassin track focus on their ability to set up devastating strikes from cover or stealth. Eventually, they learn to destroy crowds just as efficiently as they would eliminate a lone guardsman. Your Key Offensive Modifier is Dexterity, as appropriate for a stealthy character.</p>
<h3 id="1st-circle-sneak-attack-ex">1st Circle &mdash; Sneak Attack <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You know that a fair fight is a failure to plan. Any time you make an attack that hits a <code>[Flat-footed]</code>, <code>[Helpless]</code>, <code>[Confused]</code>, <code>[Dazed]</code>, <code>[Entangled]</code>, <code>[Exhausted]</code>, <code>[Stunned]</code>, <code>[Shaken]</code>, <code>[Frightened]</code>, <code>[Cowering]</code> or <code>[Panicked]</code> target, you deal 1d6 additional damage with the <code>[Precision]</code> descriptor per Assassin circle that you possess, to a maximum of 7d6.</p>
<h3 id="2nd-circle-slayers-sense-ex">2nd Circle &mdash; Slayer's Sense <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Once you go for an enemy, you're rarely inclined to let them escape alive. You can ignore <code>[Concealed]</code> and <code>[Fully concealed]</code> when attacking an opponent you have previously damaged with Sneak Attack during the <code>[Encounter]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="3rd-circle-blood-calls-to-blade-ex">3rd Circle &mdash; Blood Calls to Blade <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Any time you make an attack against an opponent subject to your Sneak Attack ability while you are not benefiting from fury bonuses to attack rolls, save DCs, or damage, you gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll.</p>
<h3 id="4th-circle-menacing-presence-ex">4th Circle &mdash; Menacing Presence <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>The sight of one of your victims leaves their allies disturbed and vulnerable. Whenever an opponent ends its turn within your <code>[Melee]</code> range of another creature you have damaged with a Sneak Attack during this <code>[Encounter]</code>, it becomes <code>[Shaken]</code> for one <code>[Round]</code>. This is a <code>[Mind-affecting]</code>, <code>[Fear]</code> effect.</p>
<h3 id="5th-circle-felling-strike-ex">5th Circle &mdash; Felling Strike <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>The shock of a Sneak Attack often causes an enemy to open their defenses. Whenever you deal additional damage with the <code>[Precision]</code> descriptor to an opponent within <code>[Melee]</code> range with your Sneak Attack ability, that opponent is knocked <code>[Prone]</code>. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the <code>[Prone]</code> condition.</p>
<h3 id="6th-circle-battle-fatigue-ex">6th Circle &mdash; Battle Fatigue <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Even if an enemy survives your first strikes, you still leave their body battered and crippled. If you deal Sneak Attack damage to an opponent twice in the same <code>[Round]</code>, that opponent is <code>[Slowed]</code> until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
<h3 id="7th-circle-no-exit-ex">7th Circle &mdash; No Exit <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Hell is one other person in particular &mdash; you. Twice per <code>[Encounter]</code>, as a swift action, you may deal additional damage equal to 5x your level on your next Sneak Attack this <code>[Round]</code>, and cause the target to be <code>[Blinded]</code> and <code>[Stunned]</code> for one <code>[Round]</code>. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) halves the additional damage and causes the opponent to become <code>[Dazzled]</code> and <code>[Entangled]</code>, instead of being <code>[Stunned]</code> and <code>[Blinded]</code>. This is a <code>[Death]</code> effect.</p>
<h2 id="swashbuckler">Swashbuckler</h2>
<p>Rogues who choose the Swashbuckler track focus on elegant, mobile combat, preferably one-on-one so that they can isolate an opponent and show off properly. Your Key Offensive Modifier is Dexterity, since you value quick mobility and finesse.</p>
<h3 id="1st-circle-dance-with-me-ex">1st Circle &mdash; Dance With Me <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Whenever you move at least 10 ft, your next attack this <code>[Round]</code> deals additional damage with the <code>[Precision]</code> descriptor equal to your KDM plus your character level.</p>
<h3 id="2nd-circle-once-more-ex">2nd Circle &mdash; Once More! <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>When you spend a standard action to make a single attack that is not part of a spell-like ability or spell, and then move at least 10 ft during the same <code>[Round]</code>, you may make a single melee attack at the end of your movement. This attack, called a <code>Once More!</code> attack, can be made another time at the end of each additional instance of movement after moving at least 10 more ft. The required distance may comprise a single movement or multiple movements (such as a pair of 5 ft steps), but a <code>Once More!</code> attack can only be made when a movement ends. If the movement is made as part of an action, you can likewise only activate <code>Once More!</code> at the end of that action. At 2nd circle you may only make one <code>Once More!</code> attack per <code>[Round]</code>. This expands to two Once More! attacks per <code>[Round]</code> at 4th circle, and three Once More! attacks per <code>[Round]</code> at 6th circle.</p>
<h3 id="3rd-circle-dirty-fighting-ex">3rd Circle &mdash; Dirty Fighting <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Your speed and finesse leave opponents demoralized and bruised, even before they are defeated. The first time you hit any opponent with a <code>Once More!</code> attack this <code>[Round]</code>, your opponent becomes <code>[Battered]</code> for two <code>[Rounds]</code>. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the <code>[Battered]</code> condition.</p>
<h3 id="4th-circle-kick-him-while-hes-down-ex">4th Circle &mdash; Kick Him While He's Down <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Once you begin to throw down, you have a knack of taking the advantage and running with it. Once per <code>[Round]</code>, after making an attack during your turn, you may immediately take two free 5 ft steps (even if you used or will use a move action to move) and make a <code>[Bonus attack]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="5th-circle-concussive-impact-ex">5th Circle &mdash; Concussive Impact <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You disorient your opponents with lightning-fast strikes. If you hit an opponent with two <code>Once More!</code> attacks in the same <code>[Round]</code>, they become <code>[Confused]</code> for one <code>[Round]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="6th-circle-panache-ex">6th Circle &mdash; Panache <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You mercilessly take advantage of openings in your opponents' defenses. Any time an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you may move 10 ft in any direction before making your attack of opportunity. In addition, every time you hit an opponent with a <code>Once More!</code> attack, you may move the target 10 ft in any direction. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="7th-circle-topsy-turvy-ex">7th Circle &mdash; Topsy Turvy <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Sometimes you roll with the punches and sometimes the punches roll with you. Your Panache ability may now move each opponent within your <code>[Melee]</code> range after you hit an opponent with a <code>Once More!</code> attack instead of just the opponent hit. Once per <code>[Round]</code> for each opponent moved, if your opponent is adjacent to an obstacle or occupied square and you are able to push them 5 ft or further, you may forgo any further movement from that activation of Panache to render that opponent <code>[Prone]</code>. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the <code>[Prone]</code> condition.</p>
<h2 id="demo-man">Demo Man</h2>
<p>Rogues who choose the Demo Man track rely on their ability to destroy all obstacles in their path. Your Key Offensive Modifier is Intelligence, as the strength of your explosives largely depends on your skill in making them.</p>
<h3 id="1st-circle-smells-like-victory-ex">1st Circle &mdash; Smells Like Victory <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You love the smell of freshly mixed exposives in the morning. Or afternoon. Or evening, for that matter. Choose an elemental descriptor (<code>[Acid]</code>, <code>[Cold]</code>, <code>[Electricity]</code>, or <code>[Fire]</code>). This choice is permanent. As a move action or a swift action, you can mix noxious chemicals into a vial, which lasts for one <code>[Round]</code>, at which point it becomes useless.</p>
<p>These vials can be thrown as attacks in an attack action, and you can throw as many vials per <code>[Round]</code> as you have vials to throw, as a ranged attack (<code>[Close]</code> range), with an item bonus to the attack roll equal to the number of Demo Man circles you possess. A target hit by the vial takes energy damage with the chosen descriptor equal to 1d4 per level you possess, plus your Key Offensive Modifier, and starts <code>[Burning]</code>. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the <code>[Burning]</code> condition.</p>
<h3 id="2nd-circle-flashbang-ex">2nd Circle &mdash; Flashbang <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Once per <code>[Round]</code>, as part of a move action, you can add a fuse to a powerful firecracker, which lasts for one <code>[Round]</code> before its volatile chemicals become useless. You can use the firecracker in either of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Flash Grenade:</strong> As a ranged attack, which can be made as part of an attack action, you can throw the firecracker at target square within <code>[Close]</code> range, which creates a 10 ft radius spread originating from that square. All creatures within the spread are <code>[Blinded]</code>
and <code>[Deafened]</code> for two <code>[Rounds]</code>. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the <code>[Blinded]</code> and <code>[Deafened]</code> conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flash Missile:</strong> You can affix the firecracker to a single ranged weapon in your possession or a vial prepared with your Smells Like
Victory ability. The next time you hit a creature with an attack using either that weapon or vial, that creature is <code>[Blinded]</code> and <code>[Deafened]</code> for one <code>[Round]</code>. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the <code>[Blinded]</code> and <code>[Deafened]</code> conditions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3rd-circle-sticky-bomb-ex">3rd Circle &mdash; Sticky Bomb <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>It dawns on you that you might want to ensure a safer escape. Once per <code>[Encounter]</code> per 4 character levels, without spending an action, you can affix a pouch of entangling goo to a single ranged weapon in your possession or a vial prepared with your Smells Like Victory ability. The next time you hit a creature with that weapon or vial before the beginning of your next turn, that creature and all creatures within a 20 ft radius spread originating from that creature are <code>[Entangled]</code> for two <code>[Rounds]</code>. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the <code>[Entangled]</code> condition.</p>
<h3 id="4th-circle-high-explosive-ex">4th Circle &mdash; High Explosive <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Your most spectacular creation yet is so volatile you'd be a fool to carry more than one... so you carry two. Twice per <code>[Encounter]</code>, as a standard action, you may create a 30 ft radius spread originating from target square within <code>[Close]</code> range, which deals 1d6 damage per level plus your KOM to creatures within the area and pushes them to the closest square outside of it, knocks them <code>[Prone]</code>, and leaves them <code>[Dazed]</code> for one <code>[Round]</code>. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the <code>[Dazed]</code> condition and halves the damage.</p>
<h3 id="5th-circle-sapper-rods-ex">5th Circle &mdash; Sapper Rods <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You've created bombs that undermine magic itself. Twice per <code>[Encounter]</code>, as a standard action, you may create a 30 ft radius spread originating from target square within <code>[Close]</code> range, and choose to do one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End two target effects created by spells or spell-like abilities of 5th circle or lower that have durations and that originate from a creature or square within the spread or targeted a creature within the spread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End a single target effect created by a spell or spell-like ability of 6th or 7th circle or lower that has a duration and that originates from a creature or square within the spread or targeted a creature within the spread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a [Dispelling] effect.</p>
<h3 id="6th-circle-cluster-bomb-ex">6th Circle &mdash; Cluster Bomb <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>The more explosives you can fit in one space, the better. Once per <code>[Encounter]</code>, as a standard action, you can detonate a cluster bomb in any square within <code>[Close]</code> range, creating a 30 ft radius spread originating from target square. This cluster bomb has three of the following effects of your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vitriol:</strong> Creatures in the spread take energy damage with the elemental descriptor chosen for your Smells Like Victory ability equal to 1d4 per level you possess, plus your Key Offensive Modifier, and starts <code>[Burning]</code>. A successful Reflex save negates the <code>[Burning]</code> condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flash:</strong> Creatures in the spread are <code>[Blinded]</code> and <code>[Deafened]</code> for two <code>[Rounds]</code>. A successful Reflex save negates this effect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tangle:</strong> Creatures in the spread are <code>[Entangled]</code> for two <code>[Rounds]</code>. A successful Reflex save negates this effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blast:</strong> Creatures in the spread take damage equal to 1d6 per level you possess, plus your Key Offensive Modifier, and are pushed to
the closest square outside of the burst, are knocked <code>[Prone]</code>, and are <code>[Dazed]</code> for one <code>[Round]</code>. A successful Reflex save negates the <code>[Dazed]</code> condition and halves the damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dispel:</strong> This is a <code>[Dispelling]</code> effect. Choose one: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End two target effects created by spells or spell-like abilities of 5th circle or lower that have durations and that originate from a creature or square within the spread or targeted a creature within the spread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End a single target effect created by a spell or spell-like ability of 6th or 7th circle or lower that has a duration and that originates from a creature or square within the spread or targeted a creature within the spread. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The DC for these Reflex saves is 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h3 id="7th-circle-show-them-all-ex">7th Circle &mdash; Show Them All <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>They laughed you out of the university &mdash; but who's laughing now? Once per <code>[Encounter]</code>, as a ranged attack, you can hurl a bomb that is beyond the wildest dreams of your stuffy professors at target square within <code>[Close]</code> range. You can make this attack as part of an attack action. The bomb detonates in a massive 60 ft radius spread originating from target square, inflicting 4 damage per level to all opponents in the vicinity. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) halves the damage. Additionally, the blast leaves a cloud of flaming debris throughout its area of effect that lasts three <code>[Rounds]</code> and deals 2 damage per character level you possess to any creature entering the debris cloud and to any creature that begins or ends its turn in the debris cloud.</p>
<h1 id="defensive-track">Defensive Track</h1>

<h2 id="acrobatic-adept">Acrobatic Adept</h2>
<p>Rogues who choose the Acrobatic Adept track rely on their athletic abilities to keep out of danger. Your Key Defensive Modifier is Constitution, as performing such an impressive series of dodges is incredibly draining.</p>
<h3 id="1st-circle-just-that-quick-ex">1st Circle &mdash; Just That Quick <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You learn to react to attacks with stunning alacrity, sometimes dodging a blow that would otherwise pierce your armor. Once per [Round] per circle you possess from this track, when an opponent who is not <code>[Concealed]</code> or <code>[Fully concealed]</code> makes an attack against you, if you are not <code>[Entangled]</code>, you may make a Reflex save and use the result in place of your AC against that attack if the result is higher than your AC.</p>
<h3 id="2nd-circle-evasion-ex">2nd Circle &mdash; Evasion <code>EX</code></h3>

<h3 id="7th-circle-faster-than-the-eye-ex">7th Circle &mdash; Faster Than the Eye <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Your exceedingly acrobatic movements, like the unpredictable movements of a fly, fool the eyes of those attempting to harm you. Whenever you use Just that Quick and your opponent's attack roll misses, you gain 20% <code>[Miss chance]</code> for one <code>[Round]</code>. This stacks with itself, but not other sources, up to a maximum of 80% <code>[Miss chance]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-ten-ninjas">I Am Ten Ninjas</h2>
<p>Practioners of the exotic art of espionage known as ninjutsu often develop near-supernatural abilities to complement their stealth training. Your Key Defensive Modifier is Wisdom, as perceptiveness and self-control are critical in learning the art of the ninja.</p>

<h2 id="fortunes-friend">Fortune's Friend</h2>

<h2 id="esoterica-radica">Esoterica Radica</h2>
<p>Some rogues are by nature gamblers, people who bet everything on chances that they can't control. Whether a rogue is crouched in an alcove hoping a guard won't glance in while passing by or setting a fuse with just enough time to sprint through a hallway, dive through a window, and land in a moat, there is always an extra variable that no rogue can control. The abilities of the Esoterica Radica let you stretch your circumstances just far enough to get past that extra variable and make a quick getaway if you still can't win.</p>
<h3 id="1st-circle-playing-it-right-ex">1st Circle &mdash; Playing it Right <code>EX</code></h3>

<h3 id="4th-circle-when-to-cheat-ex">4th Circle &mdash; When to Cheat <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Once per <code>[Round]</code>, you may take an additional swift or immediate action.</p>

<h3 id="7th-circle-gamblers-dao-ex">7th Circle &mdash; Gambler's Dao <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You've made it this far with unbelievably good luck, so you may as well keep relying on it. Whenever you roll a d20, you instead roll two d20s and choose the better result.</p>
<h2 id="esoterica-adeptus">Esoterica Adeptus</h2>
<p>Some rogues are masters of their craft, experienced in such varied fields that they always have the expertise needed at a moment's notice. Whether it's a rogue adapting to broken tools to crack a safe as a guard approaches down the hall or having stowed a tool for just such an occasion, this rogue overcomes unforeseen circumstances through sheer versatility. The abilities of the Esoterica Adeptus let you broaden your master of the world enough for you account for that last-minute snag, or at least tilt the odds in your favor if things go sour.</p>
<h3 id="path-feature-tricks-of-the-trade">Path Feature &mdash; Tricks of the Trade</h3>
<p>Choose two skill trappings from any of the skills you are proficient in. The do not need to be from the same skill.  You have advantage when rolling these two trappings.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can communicate in Thieves' Cant.</p>
<h3 id="path-feature-dilettante-talent">Path Feature &mdash; Dilettante Talent</h3>
<p>Choose one of the talents listed below. You gain new abilities at the level shown in the table for your class. For each additional circle, you may choose two additional talents.</p>

<h2 id="physical-skills">Physical Skills</h2>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<h3 id="escape-route">Escape Route</h3>
<p><em>'Never, ever, overstay your welcome.' - <strong>Andromeda</strong></em></p>
<p>Once on your turn, before you take your Standard or Move action, you can declare that you're in too deep and need a way out.  If you do, name your escape route and roll Acrobatics or Athletics versus a DC of 20 + the highest level of the enemies present.</p>
<p>On a success, you're gone. At the end of the <code>[Round]</code>, you appear in a location within <code>[Medium]</code> range that you declare as part of your escape. If your escape takes you someplace further, you can appear in that location within <code>[Far]</code> at the end of the next <code>[Round]</code>.  No creature can intercept or otherwise impede you &mdash; you effectively don't exist on the battlefield until you arrive at your location.</p>
<p>If you fail to meet the DC you can stay or go, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.  This can be damage, hangers on, a curse thrown at you as you flee, or anything else the table deems appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="acrobatics">Acrobatics</h3>
<h3 id="evasion">Evasion</h3>
<p><em>You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects.</em></p>
<p>When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Reflex saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first time each <code>[Round]</code> you must make a Reflex save you may instead roll Acrobatics.</p>
<h3 id="tumble">Tumble</h3>
<p>You gain advantage to disengage checks. In addition, while you are moving, if an enemy moves to intercept you, you can make one disengage roll per intercepting enemy as a free action to avoid that enemy, but you must stop the first time you fail any of those disengage checks.</p>

<li><strong>15 Ranks:</strong> You may take your action over the course of a full minute (10 <code>[Rounds]</code> of Focus Actions) to reduce the DC of an Breaking Restraints check by 4.</li>
<li><strong>20 Ranks:</strong> You may now roll Breaking Restraints as a Standard Action by adding 2 points to the DC of the check, instead of 5.</li>
<li><strong>25 Ranks:</strong> You no longer need to increase the DC of an Breaking Restraints check to attempt it as a Standard action.  Additionally, for every 2 minutes you spend examining a restraint, you may decrease the DC needed for you to escape it by 1.</li>

<h3 id="keymaster">Keymaster</h3>
<p><em>You have been trained as a master locksmith and lockpicker.  To a true master like you, there is no lock that can't be opened. The measure for lock's quality is simply how long it takes.</em></p>
<p>After you have failed the first check to open a specific lock, you can tell the DM you intend to put your head down and get the lock open &mdash; the DM then rolls a d6 to determine how long it takes you to open it. Usually that will be 1d6 minutes, but locks of extraordinary quality exist that take 1d6 hours or even 1d6 days. Rare locks like this protect the crown jewels of the Emperor or the Lich King's phylactery. Rumors persist of a legendary lock in the heart of Mechanus that would take even a master like you years if not centuries. It's not even about what the lock keeps safe. Maybe a mortal should never open it. It's about the challenge.</p>
