<p>The body and mind of a living being hold great and powerful secrets, for the Self is more than it is made out to be. Monks know this better than anyone else; whether it be through profound introspection or grueling training, the monk transforms a frail and transient body into a most grievous weapon, capable of feats that defy belief. The philosophies of the monks are as many as the stars in the sky, but nearly all are possessed of a powerful drive to go beyond what is humanly possible.</p>
<h1 id="party-role">Party Role</h1>
<p>Monks have very good defenses and incredible speed, allowing them to rush past enemy lines and disable or kill priority targets with quick, powerful strikes.</p>
<h1 id="monks-in-your-game">Monks in Your Game</h1>
<p>The monk can represent almost any kind of wrestler, unarmed fighter, mystic or wanderer sworn to poverty. Their special abilities and great speed can make them terrifying assassins and elusive spies.</p>
<p>Many monasteries and dojos train their own monks with a unique fighting style. To reflect the emphasis of the monk’s training, choose any two saving throws to use the Good progression. The remaining saving throw uses the Poor progression.</p>

<h1 id="offensive-style">Offensive Style</h1>
<p>The following tracks are meant to represent the primary form the monk's combat takes when neutralizing their opponent. Each of the choices below is mutually exclusive with others in this section.</p>
<h2 id="discipline-of-the-serpent">Discipline of the Serpent</h2>
<h3 id="1st-circle-external-techniques-ex">1st Circle – External Techniques <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Choose five weapon properties other than <code>[Arcane]</code>, <code>[Barbed]</code>, <code>[Distant]</code>, <code>[Hold-out]</code> or <code>[Quick-draw]</code>. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon’s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties
your Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses. You may grant it 2 such properties at 1st circle, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, and 5 at 7th. The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.</p>
<p>Attacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the <code>[Precision]</code> descriptor equal to your level.</p>
<h3 id="2nd-circle-internal-principles-ex">2nd Circle – Internal Principles <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Your combat maneuvers, and opponents’ attempts to escape or act in a <code>[Grappled]</code> or <code>[Pinned]</code> condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:</p>
<h4 id="pushing-blow">Pushing Blow</h4>
<p>As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 5 f, and you can choose to move into their previously occupied space. If you choose not to move into their space, you may instead push them 5 f in the same direction per circle of Discipline of the Serpent you possess.</p>
<p>These movements do not provoke attacks of opportunity. A successful Pushing Blow benefits from abilities that would enhance a successful Bull Rush.</p>
<h4 id="neutralize">Neutralize</h4>
<p>As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Will save or take a penalty to damage equal to the number of circles you possess in Discipline of the Serpent for 1 <code>[Round]</code>. This penalty does not stack with itself.</p>
<h3 id="3rd-circle-open-and-close-ex">3rd Circle – Open and Close <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:</p>
<h4 id="close-meridian">Close Meridian</h4>
<p>As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or be <code>[Sickened]</code> for 1 <code>[Round]</code>.</p>
<h4 id="open-gate">Open Gate</h4>
<p>As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Will save or all creatures gain a +2 bonus to skill checks against the target and saves against the target’s abilities for 1 <code>[Round]</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip, you may immediately make a <code>[Bonus attack]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="4th-circle-ceaseless-flow-ex">4th Circle – Ceaseless Flow <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Once per <code>[Round]</code>, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this <code>[Round]</code>.</p>
<p>If you replace a <code>[Bonus attack]</code> using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your <code>[Bonus attack]</code> for that <code>[Round]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="5th-circle-stop-the-breath-ex">5th Circle – Stop the Breath <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Your combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip, it is <code>[Flat-footed]</code> until the beginning of its next turn.</p>
<h3 id="6th-circle-poison-the-blood-ex">6th Circle – Poison the Blood <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Each time you deal <code>[Precision]</code> damage to an opponent with Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip during an attack action, or an opponent fails a save against any of those combat maneuvers during an attack action you make, that opponent gains an <code>[Imbalance]</code>.</p>
<p>These <code>[Imbalances]</code> cause the opponent to gain various conditions, as below, and have no other effects on the opponent. <code>[Imbalances]</code> disappear at the end of each attack action, but conditions your opponents have gained from this ability do not disappear when <code>[Imbalances]</code> do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two <code>[Imbalances]</code>: The opponent is <code>[Battered]</code> for 2 <code>[Rounds]</code>.</li>
<li>Four <code>[Imbalances]</code>: The opponent is <code>[Blinded]</code> for 1 <code>[Round]</code>.</li>
<li>Six <code>[Imbalances]</code>: The opponent is <code>[Slowed]</code> for 1 <code>[Round]</code>.</li>
<li>Eight <code>[Imbalances]</code>: The opponent is <code>[Nauseated]</code> for 1 <code>[Round]</code>.</li>
<li>Ten <code>[Imbalances]</code>: The opponent is <code>[Stunned]</code> for 1 <code>[Round]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If multiple opponents would gain <code>[Imbalances]</code> from a single combat maneuver, you instead
choose one of those opponents to gain an <code>[Imbalance]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="7th-circle-on-power-ex">7th Circle – On Power <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>You can now use Ceaseless Flow any number of times per <code>[Round]</code>, and Stop the Breath now affects any opponent you hit with Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip, regardless of whether they successfully save against it or not.</p>
<h2 id="disciple-of-the-tiger">Disciple of the Tiger</h2>
<h3 id="1st-circle-external-techniques-ex_1">1st Circle – External Techniques <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Choose five weapon properties other than <code>[Arcane]</code>, <code>[Barbed]</code>, <code>[Distant]</code>, <code>[Hold-out]</code> or <code>[Quick-draw]</code>. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon’s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties
your Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses. You may grant it 2 such properties at 1st circle, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, and 5 at 7th. The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.</p>
<p>Attacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the <code>[Precision]</code> descriptor equal to your level.</p>
<h3 id="2nd-circle-aerial-ace-ex">2nd Circle - Aerial Ace <code>EX</code></h3>
<p>Your combat maneuvers, and opponents’ attempts to escape or act in a <code>[Grappled]</code> or <code>[Pinned]</code> condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:</p>

<p>Swinging in a upward motion, you knock a target into the air. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Reflex save or begin <code>[Flying]</code>. While the target does not possess the Fly movement mode, they are unable to move until the end of your turn. If the target does not possess the Fly movement mode at the end of your turn, they cease <code>[Flying]</code>. </p>
<p>If the target never possessed the Fly movement mode from when you used Uppercut on them until the end of your turn, they take 1d6 fall damage per circle of Discipline of the Tiger you possess. If they are over a <code>[Swimming]</code> area, this damage is halved.</p>
<h4 id="axe-kick">Axe Kick</h4>
<p>Swinging in a downward motion, you slam a target to the ground.

<h4 id="forceful-blow">Forceful Blow</h4>

<h2 id="drunken-brawler">Drunken Brawler</h2>
<p>Some drinkers figure out how to integrate alcohol into their fighting style, though none would call it a Discipline. It can be surprisingly effective, and foes are often caught off guard by a Drunken Brawler's unexpected competence. Aside from the brute force unlocked by being drunk, these Drunken Brawlers can also manifest effects reminiscent of the various stages of drunkenness in those they manage to hit.</p>
<h3 id="condition-inebriated">Condition: <code>[Inebriated]</code></h3>
<p>Though you can hold your liquor well, you are undeniably drunk. Like a <code>[Confused]</code> creature, an <code>[Inebriated]</code> creature’s actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn:</p>
<table>

<th align="left">EFFECT</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">1-10</td>
<td align="left">Spend his standard or move action babbling incoherently</td>

<td align="left">Have his movement speed halved for 1 <code>[Round]</code></td>

</table>
<p>An <code>[Inebriated]</code> creature who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. If an opponent takes an offensive action against an <code>[Inebriated]</code> creature, that creature takes offensive actions against that opponent on its next turn, moving toward it as necessary as long as it is still <code>[Inebriated]</code> when its turn comes. If remaining in an Area of Effect would cause harm to an <code>[Inebriated]</code> creature, it attempts to leave that Area of Effect so long as this would not prevent it from taking offensive actions against an opponent that has just attempted to harm it.</p>
<p>An <code>[Inebriated]</code> creature does not make Attacks of Opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). Unless otherwise noted, this condition expires at the end of the <code>[Scene]</code>.
