            "text": "Gameplay Basics\n\n\nThe Core Mechanic\n\n\nTo determine if your character succeeds at a task, you roll a twenty-sided die, referred to elsewhere in this book as a \u201cd20\u201d. A roll of 20 is not an automatic success, nor is a roll of 1 an automatic failure. Compare your result to a target number (\u201cDifficulty Class\u201d, or DC, when making a skill check or saving throw, and \u201cArmor Class\u201d, or AC, when making an attack). If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.\n\n\nDice\n\n\nDice rolls are described with expressions such as \u201c3d4+5,\u201d which means \u201croll three four-sided dice and add 5\u201d (resulting in a number between 8 and 17). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the \u201cd\u201d tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result, which is called the modifier.\n\n\nd%\n\n\nPercentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100. If the result of the roll is under the required percentage chance (for example, if there is a 20% chance of something happening and you roll a 13) then the event takes place.\n\n\nTaking 10 and 20\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t always make sense for actions to carry a random element. When you are not in any danger or otherwise distracted, you may \u201ctake 10\u201d \u2013 treat a roll of a d20 as a 10 (the average) instead of rolling, to represent an average result. If you have lots of spare time and the action you are attempting carries no consequences for failing (such as straining to open a tight jar) you may treat the result of a d20 roll as a 20, but doing this means that the action takes 20 times as long as normal. In effect, it\u2019s assumed that you\u2019ve rolled the die 20 times until an actual 20 came up. Ultimately, the GM decides when you are permitted to take 10 or 20. Some tracks and feats grant abilities that may allow you to \u201ctake\u201d other values.\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Math\n\n\nOften, you may be required to divide a number to determine the numeric value of an ability or effect (such as a feat that adds one half your character level to damage). Whenever your result for any division is fractional, round down to the nearest whole number, even if the fraction was larger than \u00bd. For example, if a character added \u00bd of his level to damage, and he was level 7, he would only add 3 damage (even though half of his level would be 3\u00bd)\n\n\n\n\nModifiers\n\n\nA modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll or value. A positive modifier is a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty. In most cases, modifiers to a given check, roll, or value stack (combine for a cumulative effect) if they come from different sources and have different types (or no type at all), but do not stack if they have the same type or come from the same source (such as the same spell cast twice in succession). If the modifiers to a particular check, roll, or value do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies.\n\n\nAbility Modifier\n\n\nThe bonus or penalty associated with a particular ability score. Ability modifiers apply to checks, rolls, and values for character actions involving the corresponding abilities.\n\n\nCircumstance Modifier\n\n\nA circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors impacting the success of the task at hand, such as the presence of precisely crafted tools in a workshop. Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from essentially the same source. Circumstance modifiers are, of course, determined entirely by the GM.\n\n\nDeflection Bonus\n\n\nA deflection bonus is an increase to Armor Class caused by physical or supernatural increases in a character\u2019s ability to block and redirect incoming attacks. Deflection bonuses are typically provided by magical shields and by some track abilities that increase Armor Class.\n\n\nFeat Bonus\n\n\nA bonus granted because of a feat chosen by a particular creature. Feat bonuses do not stack with each other.\n\n\nFury Bonus\n\n\nA bonus granted by track abilities that are magnified by emotional or psychological imbalance. ury bonuses stack with other fury bonuses from the same track, but never stack with fury bonuses from other tracks. At the beginning of your turn, you may choose not to benefit from fury bonuses to attack rolls, damage, and save DCs until the beginning of your next turn. Attacks and abilities that benefit from a fury bonus to attack rolls, damage or save DCs cannot also deal [Precision] damage.\n\n\nItem Modifier\n\n\nAn item bonus or penalty is typically derived from an item in a creature\u2019s possession. Only one item bonus and one item penalty can ever be applied at a time to a given roll, check, or value.\n\n\nRacial Bonus\n\n\nA bonus granted because of innate characteristics of that type of creature. If a creature\u2019s race changes, it loses all racial bonuses it had in its previous form.\n\n\nSize Modifier\n\n\nA size bonus or penalty is derived from a creature\u2019s size category. Size modifiers of different kinds apply to Armor Class, attack rolls, and various other checks.\n\n\nUntyped Modifier\n\n\nA bonus or penalty that is not given a specific type stacks with all other bonuses and penalties, including other untyped modifiers, as long as the various untyped modifiers don\u2019t come from the same source (such as casting a spell on yourself twice).\n\n\nAbility Scores\n\n\nThe six ability scores determine the very basics of your character \u2013 how strong he is, how fast he is, how smart he is, and so forth.\n\n\nAbility Modifiers\n\n\nEach ability has a modifier, usually ranging from -5 to +5 at character generation. The table below (\u201cAbility Modifiers and Bonus Spells\u201d)  shows the modifier for each score. It also shows bonus spells, which you\u2019ll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.\n\n\nThe modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren\u2019t die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty. To calculate an ability score modifier, subtract 10 from the score, then divide the remainder by 2, rounding down.\n\n\nKey Ability Modifiers\n\n\nEach character class has two Key Ability Modifiers \u2013 a Key Offensive Modifier (KOM) and Key Defensive Modifier (KDM). KOM is used to calculate their combat skill in making attacks rolls (attack bonus) and striking down foes (damage on weapon attacks). KDM measures their skill at surviving damage (hit points) and protecting against attacks (Armor Class).\n\n\nIf a character\u2019s KDM changes, the character\u2019s hit points also increase or decrease accordingly. The KOM and KDM can never be the same ability modifier.\n\n\nSpellcasting Ability Modifiers\n\n\nEach spellcasting track has its own Spellcasting Ability Modifier (SAM) which is used to calculate DCs for their spells and determine if the character receives any additional spells besides those allotted by default.\n\n\nCharacters with a spellcasting track may receive additional spells per [Scene] if their Spellcasting Ability Modifier for that track is exceptionally high (see table 2-1). Additional spells of a circle that a character cannot otherwise cast are not gained.\n\n\nTable 2-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifier\n\n\nCircle 1\n\n\nCircle 2\n\n\nCircle 3\n\n\nCircle 4\n\n\nCircle 5\n\n\nCircle 6\n\n\nCircle 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 > n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Abilities\n\n\nEach ability partially describes your character and affects some of his or her actions.\n\n\nStrength (Dex)\n\n\nStrength is a physical ability that measures your character\u2019s muscle and physical power.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Strength modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nFortitude saving throws (if your Strength is equal to or higher than your Constitution).\n\n\nSkills that have Strength as their key ability.\n\n\nYour attacks gain a bonus to damage equal to half your Strength modifier (if positive).\n\n\n\n\nDexterity (Dex)\n\n\nDexterity is a physical ability that measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Dexterity modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nInitiative checks to determine who acts first in a combat encounter.\n\n\nReflex saving throws (if your Dexterity is equal to or higher than your Intelligence).\n\n\nSkills that have Dexterity as their key ability.\n\n\n\n\nConstitution (Con)\n\n\nConstitution is a physical ability that represents your character\u2019s vitality, stamina, and durability.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Constitution modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nFortitude saving throws (if your Constitution is equal to or higher than your Strength).\n\n\nSkills that have Constitution as their key ability.\n\n\nYou gain [Damage reduction] equal to half your Constitution modifier (if positive).\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence (Int)\n\n\nIntelligence is a mental ability that determines how well your character learns and reasons.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Intelligence modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nReflex saving throws (if your Intelligence is higher than your Dexterity).\n\n\nSkills that have Intelligence as their key ability.\n\n\n\n\nWisdom (Wis)\n\n\nWisdom is a mental ability that describes a character\u2019s willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one\u2019s ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one\u2019s surroundings.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Wisdom modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nWill saving throws (if your Wisdom is equal to or higher than your Charisma).\n\n\nSkills that have Wisdom as their key ability.\n\n\nThe Awareness defense.\n\n\n\n\nCharisma (Cha)\n\n\nCharisma is a mental ability that measures a character\u2019s force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, and ability to lead. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social Setting.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Charisma modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nWill saving throws (if your Charisma is higher than your Wisdom).\n\n\nSkills that have Charisma as their key ability.\n\n\n\n\nWhen an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly.\n\n\nSecondary Statistics\n\n\nAside from ability scores, all creatures have a set of statistics that represent their basic ability to deal and evade damage. These numbers increase as creatures increase in power through gaining levels.\n\n\nThe secondary statistics are Armor Class, Hit Points, Base Attack Bonus, and Fortitude, Reflex, and Will base saving throw bonuses. All creatures also have some capacity of noticing things others don\u2019t want them to, which is represented by the Awareness defense.\n\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\n\nArmor Class, measures a character\u2019s skill at evading physical attacks.\n\n\n\n\nYou calculate AC as follows: \n10 + level + KDM + misc. modifiers\n.\n\n\n\n\nHit points (HP)\n\n\nHit points measure a character\u2019s overall combat endurance. Your HP largely depend on your class; each class offers 8, 10, or 12 hit points, plus your KDM, per level, with twice as many HP at 1st level. For example, a 1st-level barbarian with Constitution 16 would have 26 HP (10 class HP, plus a Constitution KDM of 3, doubled for 1st level). At 2nd level, that same barbarian would have 39 HP.\n\n\n\n\nYou calculate HP as follows: \n(Class HP + KDM) * (level + 1) + misc. modifiers\n.\n\n\n\n\nBase Attack Bonus (BAB)\n\n\nBase Attack Bonus measures a character\u2019s basic skill at combat. It increases at one of two different rates, depending on a character\u2019s class, as detailed on table 2-2 (\u201cBase Attack Bonus\u201d).\n\n\nYou use BAB to calculate an attack roll against an enemy, as follows: 1d20 + BAB + your character\u2019s Key Offensive Modifier + any other applicable modifiers. Whenever you make an attack roll, if the result equals or exceeds the target\u2019s Armor Class, the attack hits that target.\n\n\nWhen they take an attack action, characters with a BAB of +6 or higher gain one or more extra attacks, albeit made with a lower attack bonus, as shown on table 2-2. The values given on racial track and class tables in this document only list full BAB; the lower bonus for additional attacks is extrapolated using table 2-2.\n\n\n\n\nCalculating To-Hit: \n1d20 + BAB + KOM + misc. modifiers\n.\n\n\n\n\nBase Attack Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nGood\n\n\nPoor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n6 / 1\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n7 / 2\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n8 / 3\n\n\n6 / 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n9 / 4\n\n\n6 / 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n10 / 5\n\n\n7 / 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n11 / 6 x 2\n\n\n8 / 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n12 / 7 x 2\n\n\n9 / 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n13 / 8 x 2\n\n\n9 / 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n14 / 9 x 2\n\n\n10 / 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n15 / 10 x 2\n\n\n11 / 6 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n16 / 11 x 3\n\n\n12 / 7 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n17 / 12 x 3\n\n\n12 / 7 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n18 / 13 x 3\n\n\n13 / 8 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n19 / 14 x 3\n\n\n14 / 9 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n20 / 15 x 3\n\n\n15 / 10 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n21 / 16 x 4\n\n\n16 / 11 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n22 / 17 x 4\n\n\n17 / 12 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n23 / 18 x 4\n\n\n18 / 13 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n24 / 19 x 4\n\n\n18 / 13 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n25 / 20 x 4\n\n\n19 / 14 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n26 / 21 x 5\n\n\n20 / 15 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n27 / 22 x 5\n\n\n21 / 16 x 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n28 / 23 x 5\n\n\n21 / 16 x 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n29 / 24 x 5\n\n\n22 / 17 x 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n30 / 25 x 5\n\n\n23 / 18 x 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwareness\n\n\nAwareness is your character\u2019s general ability to notice when someone else is trying to perform an action while remaining unnoticed. You calculate Awareness as follows: 10 + your level + your character\u2019s Wisdom modifier + any other applicable modifiers.\n\n\nSaving Throws\n\n\nSaving throw bonuses are used to calculate \u201csaving throws\u201d or \u201csaves,\u201d which are d20 rolls made to resist particular types of abilities. Abilities that require a save specify the type of save required, but a general guide for what saves resist which types of effect is given below. You can make a saving throw against an effect whenever it would specifically allow you to, or whenever that effect would affect you differently on a successful save. Unless otherwise specified, you can only make a single save against each individual effect. Saving throw bonuses are based on a character\u2019s level and choice of class, and are given in the table for a character\u2019s chosen class. A save succeeds if its result equals or exceeds a listed Difficulty Class (DC), which is always given in the text of the ability or effect that triggers the save. You may always decline to make a save against an effect that triggers a save. This is treated as failing the save for that effect.\n\n\nFortitude\n\n\nFortitude (Fort) is a character\u2019s ability to resist effects that eat away at that character\u2019s physical body or crush it outright, such as poison or a cartoonishly impractical anvil. You calculate Fortitude as follows: 1d20 + your base Fortitude bonus + the higher of your Strength and Constitution modifiers + any other applicable modifiers.\n\n\nReflex\n\n\nReflex (Ref) is a character\u2019s ability to dodge area effects, such as explosions, as well as most traps. You calculate Reflex as follows: 1d20 + your base Reflex bonus + the higher of your Dexterity and Intelligence modifiers + any other applicable modifiers.\n\n\nWill\n\n\nWill is a character\u2019s ability to resist assaults on the mind, such as scary things or mind control. You calculate Will as follows: 1d20 + your base Will bonus + the higher of your Wisdom and Charisma modifiers + any other applicable modifiers.",

If you are playing a one-shot or a similar brief game, and only require enough information to fill out a character sheet, you can use the Quick Start Guide to generate a character. If you are playing a longer game, you may wish to devote a little more time and effort to developing a character concept and finding the mechanical abilities that best support it.\n\n\nQuick Start Guide\n\n\nTo create a character quickly, follow these steps:\n\n\n1. Choose a Race\n\n\nChoose a race from the options detailed in Section IV.\n\n\n2. Choose a Class\n\n\nChoose a class from Section V.  If you have to make choices associated with your tracks (such as spell selection or choosing between different tracks for which you\u2019re eligible), make them now and write your tracks and track abilities down on your character sheet.\n\n\n3. Assign Ability Scores\n\n\nThe default ability scores in Legend are 16, 14, 14, 12, 10, and 10. Assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, in the order you prefer. In general, it is best to assign high scores to your character\u2019s Key Abilities, since those are the abilities on which your character most relies in a broad variety of situations.\n\n\nIf you are creating a higher-level character, consult table 3-2 (\u201cCharacter Advancement\u201d) and increase your character\u2019s ability scores by the amounts given for a character of the appropriate level.\n\n\nFor example, a 7th-level barbarian with the Rage track might choose to increase Strength by +4 and Constitution by +2, and could increase any other ability score by +2 as well.\n\n\n4. Note Your Class Skills\n\n\nYour class skills are those skills that all members of your class are generally adept at.  They can be found listed with your class.  You gain a bonus equal to one-half your level on all skill checks using a class skill, as explained in Section VII.\n\n\n5. Choose Your Trained Skills\n\n\nChoose skills from Section VII.  The number of skills available to the class you chose is noted at the top of your class. The skills you choose are considered \u201ctrained\u201d. You gain a bonus equal to one-half your level on all skill checks using trained skills, as explained in Section VII.  The bonus from training stacks with the bonus from a skill being considered a class skill.\n\n\n6. Choose Your Feats\n\n\nChoose feats for your character from Section VIII. A first-level character has two feat slots, one of which must be chosen from the bonus feat for your character\u2019s race, as explained in Section IV.\n\n\nIf you are building a higher-level character, choose additional feats at the levels shown on table 3-2.\n\n\n7. Choose Your Items\n\n\nChoose items for your character from Section XIII. A 1st character may have a reasonable number of mundane items and a single Lesser item. You gain the ability to use additional magic items as noted on table 3-2 (\u201cCharacter Advancement\u201d); choose as many additional magic items as you can use, per the table. As explained in Section XIII, you are not limited in your choice of mundane items except by your character concept; consult with your group if you are unclear on this point.\n\n\nUnless your character is a spellcaster or otherwise has a wide range of offensive options, you should generally select a broad variety of weapons (including both ranged and melee weapons). If you\u2019re a higher-level character (5th level or higher), it is also generally wise to ensure your character is able to quickly move around the battlefield, via flight, teleportation, and similar abilities.\n\n\n8. Fill in the Blanks\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t written down or added up anything on your character sheet (such as your character\u2019s Base Attack Bonus, saving throw bonuses, or other numerical values), put it down now. You\u2019ve already made the important choices in building your character, so you should be able to fill in the rest of the numbers without any trouble.\n\n\nAdvanced Character Creation\n\n\nIf you\u2019re playing in a long campaign, or have already selected a character concept that isn\u2019t covered by the standard races or classes, you may wish to put a little more effort into your character than is involved in following the quick start rules. Legend offers a great many character options that don\u2019t appear in the default races and classes. If you want to learn to use these options, look no further.\n\n\nFirst, though, let\u2019s look briefly at character concepts. It\u2019s perfectly alright to flesh out your character with a cool feat you just stumbled across or a couple of items you wanted to try, but it\u2019s usually helpful to start character generation with a pretty good idea of what you want your character to do. Some suggestions follow.\n\n\nCharacter Concepts\n\n\nThe first step in developing a character concept is thinking of a tag line. This can be a description of your character\u2019s profession (\u201cInterstellar Smuggler\u201d or \u201cUndersized Burglar\u201d) or social position (\u201cLong-lost King of a Great City\u201d). Other idea that have worked well in the past include \u201c\u2018Wizard\u2019 on the Run,\u201d \u201cBearer of Stormbringer,\u201d \u201cCheerleader Who Kills Vampires,\u201d and \u201cWizard Private Eye.\u201d\n\n\nOnce you have a tag-line that you expect to hold your interest for the duration of a Legend campaign, start asking yourself a few questions about your character. Usually, your tag line will give you some sense of your character\u2019s race and possibly a few clues to answering these questions.\n\n\n\u201cWhat does my character want?\u201d This probably won\u2019t get you much mechanically, but knowing your character\u2019s greatest motivations might give you a clue of how your character goes about getting them. A character that is admittedly just in it for the money is going to make different life choices from a character that is out to do the right thing and help the helpless. Even if the answer doesn\u2019t help you at all in picking abilities for your character, it\u2019ll pay off in a big way in getting plot hooks for your GM and helping you make decisions in-character.\n\n\n\u201cWhat does my character fear?\u201d This question is pretty good for building a backstory, but it also offers some really rich options for mechanical choices. For example, someone who fears harm coming to his or her friends might focus on learning to protect them, perhaps with the paladin\u2019s Virtue track.\n\n\n\u201cHow does my character resolve conflicts?\u201d Any good story is centered on a basic conflict, and RPGs tend to include a few dozen extra conflicts for good measure. If your character doesn\u2019t end up in fights, chances are you\u2019ll find social confrontations, environmental hazards, or similarly threatening situations. Ability tracks in Legend offers a broad range of abilities for solving or ending confrontations, and your answers to this question might point you to the right ones.\n\n\n\u201cHow does my character make a living?\u201d Most RPG characters aren\u2019t conventionally employed, especially if your game world is a medieval fantasy setting where wage labor doesn\u2019t exist. Still, your character probably has some things that he or she is good at \u2013 maybe even extremely good at. RPG characters tend to be skilled in at least a few useful areas, such as arcane knowledge, investigative and social skills, or physical speed and agility. Your answers here will tell you a great deal about your character\u2019s skill selection.\n\n\n\u201cWhat special tricks does my character keep handy?\u201d This question will help you select feats, particularly [Iconic] feats. It may also help you select a specialized track, such as several of the rogue tracks in Section V.\n\n\nRace Selection\n\n\nUsually, you\u2019ll have some idea of your character\u2019s race by now. If not, you can find the default races in Section IV, as well as a number of additional races in Section VI. If your group is using supplemental material as well, you may have even more options. For the most part, picking a race is purely a matter of taste, as most races can fit a wide range of\n\n\ncharacter archetypes. Some races, however, represent unusual creatures, such as powerful undead creatures, intelligent constructs, or even dragons. In cases where your race includes dramatic, scaling abilities (such as the undead powers of a lich), your race will have a track associated with it. All members of that race have the associated track, and you will have to incorporate that track in your track selection.\n\n\nClass and Track Selection\n\n\nSelecting your class and associated tracks is the single most critical part of character generation, mechanically speaking. If you already have a default class picked out, then you can move on. However, you may want to customize your class at the very least, and choosing a race with an associated track makes this section obligatory.\n\n\nThe classes described in Section V each contain three \u201ctracks\u201d\u2013 progressions of abilities that define much of your character\u2019s mechanical role. Each class also has a set of statistics, such as the number of hit points per level that it grants and the saving throw and attack bonus progressions it offers (you can find this information in the class descriptions, or compiled in the table below).\n\n\nThere are three options for customizing your character\u2019s tracks: a racial track, multiclassing, and Full Buy-In.\n\n\nRacial Tracks\n\n\nAs described above, racial tracks model the abilities of certain powerful creatures, such as dragons, vampires, and angels. These are creatures whose powers are at least partly a facet of their nature; some dragons breathe fire and others rely on clawing your face off, but all of them are flying reptilian creatures who can take a lot of punishment, live a long time, and collect anything valuable they can get their claws on. These are sufficiently iconic and important to justify attaching them automatically to anything calling itself a dragon (unless you\u2019re a Chinese dragon, in which case you would choose a different track). Since racial tracks are a fundamental aspect of how your character interacts with the world, they include a full set of class statistics, including hit points, saving throw and attack bonus progressions, and key ability modifiers. If you have a racial track, choose any class, then two tracks from that class. Treat this combination of tracks and class statistics as your character\u2019s class. Your two chosen tracks retain their progressions from the chosen class, and your racial track gains the progression not used by either of the other tracks. You can multiclass from that class just as if you had a standard class, except that you can\u2019t trade out your racial track.\n\n\nMulticlassing\n\n\nAs explained above, tracks are the building blocks of characters. So if you want to create a \u201chybrid\u201d character like the ranger/rogue of times past, you simply trade a track of \u201cranger\u201d abilities you feel are less important for a track of \u201crogue\u201d abilities.\n\n\nYou can always trade one such track for free, and you can trade another track out with the Guild Initiation feat (more on that in a moment).\n\n\nWhen you multiclass, you select a single track from either another class or from one of the many additional tracks available (excluding racial tracks) and replace one of your default tracks with it. You gain the features of your new track at the same levels you would have gained the features of the track that was replaced. You cannot gain any track more than once. Some tracks are part of the same overall track, and therefore you cannot have more than one of them for any reason. For example, the three options for the rogue\u2019s Offensive Track are mutually exclusive, as with the rogue\u2019s Defensive Track options, the ranger\u2019s Daggers and Bolts options, the barbarian\u2019s Path of War options, and the Sage\u2019s Wrath options.\n\n\nWhen finding a multiclassing track, note that some tracks represent different ways of doing the same thing and therefore aren\u2019t meant to work well together. For example, the Rage, Assassin, and Discipline of the Serpent tracks are all meant to provide characters with a way to do a great deal of damage while fighting, but each models a different style of fighting (a barbarian\u2019s berserk destruction, a hit man\u2019s surprise attacks from the shadows, and a martial artist\u2019s fast and precise striking combinations). In general, if you see that one track\u2019s features are tagged as not stacking with another track\u2019s features, avoid combining them.\n\n\nSome tracks are associated with a particular ability score and function based on that ability. For example, spellcasting tracks are associated with a particular mental ability, while the effectiveness of the Demo Man track will depend on the character\u2019s Intelligence. The Multiclass Flexibility feat allows you to adapt the DCs of a single track\u2019s features to be based on a different ability (with certain limitations) in order to make that track work better for your character. In some cases, you should simply consider whether your character is best off with a track that doesn\u2019t fit with the key abilities you had in mind, or whether it makes more sense for your character to pursue the same basic goal in a different way.\n\n\nLegend classes are typically built to have one track that is largely offensive in nature, one that offers some defense or utility, and one that can be either offensive or defensive but tends to make the class somewhat unique in its playstyle and archetype. When deciding which original track to replace, it\u2019s often wise to consider the kind of role that your new track will play. It\u2019s not necessarily \u201cwrong\u201d to end up with three offensively-oriented tracks, but it does mean that your character will be focused almost exclusively on offense and will largely lack defensive abilities. If you think you may be in this situation, take a moment to consider whether your character concept supports such a hell-for-leather approach to combat and confrontation. If so, go for it! If not, you may be trying to do one thing several different ways, and you might want to reconsider your track choices.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, you can multiclass once for free at character creation. This simply represents having somewhat different abilities from a normal character with this class. There is one other way to multiclass, but it isn\u2019t free. The Guild Initiation feat models a character who is particularly committed to an organization, ideal, or patron, and at some point goes through a process of fundamental change. At the level your character takes this feat, your character loses a track and gains a new track, rewriting the previously acquired features of the sacrificed track with the features of the new track. This process can be used to even gain the features of a racial track, but grants only the track features and does not change overall class statistics or racial traits.\n\n\nFull Buy-In\n\n\nThe Full Buy-In option involves sacrificing the vast majority of your character\u2019s item progression\n\n\nin exchange for gaining a fourth track. This track can be any multiclassing-eligible track or a racial track, but offers only track abilities and never rewrites class statistics. The revised schedule for item progression, along with the levels at which you gain track features from the fourth track, can be found in Section XIII.\n\n\nAbility Score Selection\n\n\nBy this time, you should know your Key Ability Modifiers and have a very good sense of any other abilities that your character would most value and emphasize. So, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to assign your ability scores. This is, however, a fairly good time to discuss the different methods of generating ability scores in Legend. Your group will decide on one of the following methods, to be used for all player characters in your game (NPCs and monsters generally are designed based on the ability array).\n\n\nAbility Array:\n The default ability scores in Legend are 16, 14, 14, 12, 10, and 10, assigned to whichever abilities you prefer. Legend\u2019s game math is based on this ability array, because it provides a predictable common basis for ability scores.\n\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Standard Array\n\n\nStandard Array: \n16, 14, 14, 12, 10, 10\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe array above reflects an exceptionally gifted creature, who is good at most things and is mediocre in only a couple spots. An array that would reflect a more normal (if still a bit above average) creature might be 14, 12, 12, 10, 10, 8. We believe that most RPG characters are expected to be a bit larger than life, but some groups might want a grittier game in which the player characters are just normal people. Using a lower array like this one could help create such a game; of course, we must emphasize that this kind of decision should only be made by an entire group, not unilaterally. Note that an increase or decrease in the default ability array will tend to make player characters inherently more or less powerful respectively compared to standard monsters and pre-generated NPCs of the same level, and that this shift in power will affect gameplay.\n\n\nPoint Buy\n\n\nIn this version of ability score generation, all scores start at 8. You have a pool of 26 points that you can apply to your scores as you wish, 2 points at a time. You cannot increase a single ability score above 18. Using point buy gives players some flexibility in choosing the ability scores that best suit their character. It is possible to achieve somewhat unusual results with this method, such as creatures with a couple of extremely high ability scores and several very low ability scores, so this method is best used in groups where all the players understand the game mechanics well enough to avoid serious mistakes in allocating ability scores.\n\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Point Buy\n\n\nAll stats start at \n8\n. You have a pool of 26 points, which can be spent \n2\n at a time to increase your stats. You can't spend points to go above \n18\n in any stat.\n\n\n\n\nSkill Selection\n\n\nSkill selection should be pretty easy at this point. If you have a strong character concept and know what ability scores you wish to prioritize, picking skills that correspond with those should be easy. Be sure to pick up any skills that you will need to use your track features effectively.\n\n\nFeat Selection\n\n\nWhen selecting feats, always check for \u201cfeat trees\u201d \u2013 series of two or three feats that each require the previous one \u2013 that you want. If you decide that you want a feat tree, make sure you have the feat slots you need to get it first, before you look for individual feats. Other than that, select feats that give your character something cool to do, offer a new application of a skill you already have, or make your character better at your main character goal.\n\n\n[Iconic]\n feats are special feats that grant a particularly unique power. Your character can only have one, so you will generally want to pick one that really embodies your character concept. It\u2019s particularly important to avoid picking a feat that your character can\u2019t support, such as one with a DC based on an ability modifier your character hasn\u2019t invested in.\n\n\nItem Selection\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to go wrong on items. In general, you should have a weapon or some other item that allows you to win fights, armor or some other item that helps you not be stabbed, and items that make you happy. Some of these don\u2019t even need to be magical; until you\u2019re a mid-level character, it actually isn\u2019t all that important to pick up magical protective gear because you get nearly as much Armor Class bonus from mundane equipment.\n\n\nPolishing Your Character\n\n\nCongratulations! You should have a reasonably competent character now, built on an enjoyable and interesting character concept. You\u2019re done now\u2026right?\n\n\nWrong! Being the smart person you are, you\u2019ve undoubtedly figured out all of this and built a character with a minimum of hassle and reworks. Now, while the other clowns at your gaming table are working out their character missteps and kinks, you have a chance to make your character really shine. This is where you start coming up with your character\u2019s backstory, expanding on the motivations you figured out back when you came up with your character concept to begin with. You can sketch your character, if you\u2019re artistically gifted. You can figure out how your character got to know all the other players\u2019 characters.\n\n\nThe bottom line is, this guide tells you how to fill out your character sheet in a way that won\u2019t cause you any serious embarrassments. Once your character sheet is full, there\u2019s always more you can do to build your character.\n\n\nCreating a Character above 1st level\n\n\nMany games feature characters higher than 1st level, and feature characters who are much more significant in terms of power and capability. To start play with a character higher than 1st level, follow the steps below.\n\n\nAbility Selection\n\n\nAbility scores are generated in the same way when making a 1st level character. Then, consult table 3-2 (\u201cCharacter Advancement\u201d) and increase your ability scores by the amounts given for a character of your level. For example, a 7th-level barbarian with the Rage track would likely choose to increase Strength by +4 and Constitution by +2, and could increase any other score by +2 as well (depending on the specific character).\n\n\nRace, Class, and Skill Selection\n\n\nAll of these are done exactly as if making a 1st level character. Your class choice, as well as any tracks acquired through multiclassing, is the same as a 1st-level character; however, you gain all the abilities possessed by a character of your level, per Section V and Section XIII. You have ranks in your chosen skills equal to your level, as explained in Section VII.\n\n\nFeat Selection\n\n\nChoose a number of feats equal to the number of feat slots given for your level in table 3-2. You must meet all prerequisites for a feat at the level you acquire the slot for that feat (so you can\u2019t put a feat in the level 6 slot if it has a prerequisite of character level 9).\n\n\nSpell Selection\n\n\nChoose the abilities you want your character to possess at every level where you have a choice between different spells, powers, or abilities.\n\n\nItem Selection\n\n\nChoose a set of items, consumables, and other commodities from the list given in Section XIII. Consult table 3-2 to determine what kinds of items you are entitled to, and how many of each kind you can use. Characters who have chosen the Full Buy-In option (see Section XIII) receive many fewer items than normal.\n\n\nTable 3-2: Character Advancement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nFeat\n\n\nMovement Speed\n\n\nAbility 1\n\n\nAbility 2\n\n\nAbility 3\n\n\nAbility 4\n\n\nNew Item Slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+0ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+5ft\n\n\n+2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+5ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n+5ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+10ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n+10ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+10ft\n\n\n+4\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n+15ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+15ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+4\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nRelic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n+15ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+20ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n+20ft\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+20ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n+25ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nRelic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+25ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n+25ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+30ft\n\n\n+8\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n+30ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+8\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+30ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n+35ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+4\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+40ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n+40ft\n\n\n+10\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+40ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+10\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n+45ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+8\n\n\n-\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+45ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n+45ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+50ft\n\n\n+12\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nRelic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n+50ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+12\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+50ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+10\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n+55ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+8\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveling Up\n\n\n\u201cLeveling up\u201d is the process your character goes through every time you gain a level. An increase in level is a big deal \u2013 your character gains a powerful new ability, as well as becoming more resilient and skilled. There are a few steps to leveling up a character. You can take these steps in whatever order is most beneficial \u2013 if there is a prerequisite you would meet with one step of the leveling process, you meet that prerequisite at another step of the leveling process even if those steps are \u201cout of order\u201d as listed here.\n\n\nIncrease Hit Points and Saving Throw Bonuses\n\n\nWhenever you level up, your maximum hit points increase by the number given in your character class entry plus your KDM. For example, a barbarian gains 10 hit points plus the barbarian\u2019s Constitution modifier at every new level.\n\n\nWhenever you level up, set your base saving throw bonuses to the values listed on the table for your character class for your new level.\n\n\nIncrease Ability Scores\n\n\nAt some levels, as marked out by table 3-2, your character gains an ability score increase. Increase your chosen ability score now. The four ability score increase progressions must apply to different ability scores, and your choice of assigning a given ability to a given increase progression is permanent. The increases in ability scores are not cumulative. For example, at level 17, your primary ability is +8 higher than it was at level 1, not +20.\n\n\nChoose New Track Feature\n\n\nMany tracks offer a choice between different abilities. If any of your ability tracks for this level offer a choice, pick an ability now. Otherwise, simply make a note of your new track ability. Any benefits that you gain at a certain circle or level are available to characters from that level onward.\n\n\nIncrease Skills\n\n\nIncrease your chosen skills by 1 rank each.\n\n\nChoose New Feat\n\n\nEvery odd level you gain a feat. If your new level is odd, choose a feat.\n\n\nSelect Item\n\n\nAt some levels (as shown on table 3-2), your character gains a new magic item slot (you can possess more magic items than you have slots, but can only attune to as many magic items as you have slots \u2013 see Section XIII). This may happen at level-up, as part of quest rewards, or you may have earned or found the item prior to leveling up.\n\n\nIncrease Movement Speed\n\n\nHigher-level characters become quicker and more mobile. At 2nd level, and at every three levels afterward, your character\u2019s movement speed increases by 5 ft.\n\n\nHigher-level Characters and System Expectations\n\n\nAs characters gain levels in Legend, they gain power. Every time a character gains a level, the level offers a new track feature: a unique capability that can dramatically alter the outcome of an encounter. In Legend, we expect characters at different levels to interact with and affect the world around them in different ways. 1st through 5th level characters generally have capabilities that are fairly reasonable for ordinary humans (aside from magic abilities, of course). But characters at higher levels are legendary heroes or demigods. When designing your character, you should consider your character\u2019s starting level and prepare to face enemies of appropriate power and capability. Some of the relevant considerations follow: Between 5th and 10th level, abilities like medium-range teleportation and flight become extremely common. As characters reach the higher end of that level range, you need to either have special movement abilities or the ability to attack creatures who use them (usually by having a ranged weapon or offensive magic). Around this same level, many characters also gain innate healing and abilities that can affect many opponents at once. Characters in this level range can\u2019t take on an army of ordinary humans, but they can break that army with careful tactics and piecemeal engagements.\n\n\nBetween 11th level and 15th level, creatures can access [Death] abilities \u2013 attacks that do massive damage and can cripple or kill a character outright. Long-range teleportation and other \u201cfast travel\u201d abilities appear, and many creatures gain immunities to certain attacks and abilities. Knowledge checks and divinatory abilities become quite important to reveal what an opponent can do and how an opponent can be effectively harmed. Creatures in this level range can attack an entire army of ordinary humans without being seriously harmed, and often a single survivor of an adventuring party can find a way to resurrect fallen comrades with a little effort.\n\n\nFrom 16th level on, many creatures become extremely difficult to kill. At this level, characters approach deific power. Creatures can often ignore a round\u2019s worth of attacks outright, or survive otherwise-deadly attacks, or even spontaneously revive if killed once. Many characters also dramatically improve their offensive abilities. Characters in this level range are barely even threatened by an army of ordinary humans.\n\n\nBeyond 20th level, you're dealing with a pack of roving demi-gods. Prepare for that.\n\n\nLevel Progression\n\n\nWithin the core canon of Legend, we expect level increases to be handed out at thematically appropriate points by GMs. This is because we don\u2019t know when or how you expect characters to increase in power. Do you want them to grow meaningfully in the course of a quest? As the result of a great revelation? As part of a soul-searching moment before the big fight? In general, we certainly recommend that players level up once per [Quest] or per plot arc, but this might not mesh well with the flow of your story, and you may have trouble with the flow of the campaign versus the flow of time in real life. A set experience progression leaves you with relatively fewer good mechanisms of recourse, which was the core motivation behind our decision that experience was a meta-game construct that didn\u2019t serve us well.\n\n\nIt bears mention, however, that we do think parties should be comprised of characters who are the same level, and much of the math behind Legend is written with this in mind. It\u2019s a view we hold due to the elegance of that situation, and the fact that it decreases player conflict. No one wants to be the runt of the litter, and we have better ways to portray interdependency among characters than to force someone into the life of the side-kick or mascot.\n\n\nOptional Rules for Power Increases\n\n\nThere are a couple of advantages to using a fixed progression, however, and we provide one as an optional framework for running certain kinds of campaigns. One of the big advantages is that it\u2019s visibly and completely impartial. It measures success along a clean and visible metric, which is just a good feeling and a good thing. It also fits pretty well with the Dungeon Crawl, where you\u2019re slicing your way through the legions of evil in pursuit of power and loot. In such a situation, you might want players to be able to choose what parts of a dungeon they work through, in the interest of providing a more open and free roaming experience. Another advantage is being able to portray power as less of a narrative progression. The following is a suggested progression that provides a comparatively fast trip through low levels, a fairly smooth progression through mid-game, and a slower progression through end-game.\n\n\nFor this type of progression, encounters of EL-2 (see Section X) are worth one experience point; encounters of EL-1 are worth two; encounters of EL+0 are worth three; and encounters of EL+1 are worth five. An EL+2 encounter is worth seven points, but is rarely survivable. Encounters outside this range are generally not appropriate challenges. A party gains points for any combat encounter they win, or any combat encounter they obviate through non-combat means. This can include clever escapes at the GM\u2019s discretion. However, if the party resolves an encounter without fighting, they only gain experience for the creatures they interacted with and not for any reinforcements in the background.",

This can be a description of your character\u2019s profession (\u201cInterstellar Smuggler\u201d or \u201cUndersized Burglar\u201d) or social position (\u201cLong-lost King of a Great City\u201d).

Usually, your tag line will give you some sense of your character\u2019s race and possibly a few clues to answering these questions.  \u201cWhat does my character want?\u201d This probably won\u2019t get you much mechanically, but knowing your character\u2019s greatest motivations might give you a clue of how your character goes about getting them. A character that is admittedly just in it for the money is going to make different life choices from a character that is out to do the right thing and help the helpless. Even if the answer doesn\u2019t help you at all in picking abilities for your character, it\u2019ll pay off in a big way in getting plot hooks for your GM and helping you make decisions in-character.  \u201cWhat does my character fear?\u201d This question is pretty good for building a backstory, but it also offers some really rich options for mechanical choices. For example, someone who fears harm coming to his or her friends might focus on learning to protect them, perhaps with the paladin\u2019s Virtue track.  \u201cHow does my character resolve conflicts?\u201d Any good story is centered on a basic conflict, and RPGs tend to include a few dozen extra conflicts for good measure. If your character doesn\u2019t end up in fights, chances are you\u2019ll find social confrontations, environmental hazards, or similarly threatening situations. Ability tracks in Legend offers a broad range of abilities for solving or ending confrontations, and your answers to this question might point you to the right ones.  \u201cHow does my character make a living?\u201d Most RPG characters aren\u2019t conventionally employed, especially if your game world is a medieval fantasy setting where wage labor doesn\u2019t exist. Still, your character probably has some things that he or she is good at \u2013 maybe even extremely good at. RPG characters tend to be skilled in at least a few useful areas, such as arcane knowledge, investigative and social skills, or physical speed and agility. Your answers here will tell you a great deal about your character\u2019s skill selection.  \u201cWhat special tricks does my character keep handy?\u201d This question will help you select feats, particularly [Iconic] feats.

For the most part, picking a race is purely a matter of taste, as most races can fit a wide range of  character archetypes. Some races, however, represent unusual creatures, such as powerful undead creatures, intelligent constructs, or even dragons. In cases where your race includes dramatic, scaling abilities (such as the undead powers of a lich), your race will have a track associated with it.

The classes described in Section V each contain three \u201ctracks\u201d\u2013 progressions of abilities that define much of your character\u2019s mechanical role. Each class also has a set of statistics, such as the number of hit points per level that it grants and the saving throw and attack bonus progressions it offers (you can find this information in the class descriptions, or compiled in the table below).

These are sufficiently iconic and important to justify attaching them automatically to anything calling itself a dragon (unless you\u2019re a Chinese dragon, in which case you would choose a different track). Since racial tracks are a fundamental aspect of how your character interacts with the world, they include a full set of class statistics, including hit points, saving throw and attack bonus progressions, and key ability modifiers. If you have a racial track, choose any class, then two tracks from that class. Treat this combination of tracks and class statistics as your character\u2019s class. Your two chosen tracks retain their progressions from the chosen class, and your racial track gains the progression not used by either of the other tracks.

            "text": "As explained above, tracks are the building blocks of characters. So if you want to create a \u201chybrid\u201d character like the ranger/rogue of times past, you simply trade a track of \u201cranger\u201d abilities you feel are less important for a track of \u201crogue\u201d abilities.  You can always trade one such track for free, and you can trade another track out with the Guild Initiation feat (more on that in a moment).  When you multiclass, you select a single track from either another class or from one of the many additional tracks available (excluding racial tracks) and replace one of your default tracks with it. You gain the features of your new track at the same levels you would have gained the features of the track that was replaced. You cannot gain any track more than once. Some tracks are part of the same overall track, and therefore you cannot have more than one of them for any reason. For example, the three options for the rogue\u2019s Offensive Track are mutually exclusive, as with the rogue\u2019s Defensive Track options, the ranger\u2019s Daggers and Bolts options, the barbarian\u2019s Path of War options, and the Sage\u2019s Wrath options.  When finding a multiclassing track, note that some tracks represent different ways of doing the same thing and therefore aren\u2019t meant to work well together. For example, the Rage, Assassin, and Discipline of the Serpent tracks are all meant to provide characters with a way to do a great deal of damage while fighting, but each models a different style of fighting (a barbarian\u2019s berserk destruction, a hit man\u2019s surprise attacks from the shadows, and a martial artist\u2019s fast and precise striking combinations). In general, if you see that one track\u2019s features are tagged as not stacking with another track\u2019s features, avoid combining them.  Some tracks are associated with a particular ability score and function based on that ability. For example, spellcasting tracks are associated with a particular mental ability, while the effectiveness of the Demo Man track will depend on the character\u2019s Intelligence. The Multiclass Flexibility feat allows you to adapt the DCs of a single track\u2019s features to be based on a different ability (with certain limitations) in order to make that track work better for your character. In some cases, you should simply consider whether your character is best off with a track that doesn\u2019t fit with the key abilities you had in mind, or whether it makes more sense for your character to pursue the same basic goal in a different way.  Legend classes are typically built to have one track that is largely offensive in nature, one that offers some defense or utility, and one that can be either offensive or defensive but tends to make the class somewhat unique in its playstyle and archetype. When deciding which original track to replace, it\u2019s often wise to consider the kind of role that your new track will play. It\u2019s not necessarily \u201cwrong\u201d to end up with three offensively-oriented tracks, but it does mean that your character will be focused almost exclusively on offense and will largely lack defensive abilities. If you think you may be in this situation, take a moment to consider whether your character concept supports such a hell-for-leather approach to combat and confrontation. If so, go for it! If not, you may be trying to do one thing several different ways, and you might want to reconsider your track choices.  As mentioned above, you can multiclass once for free at character creation. This simply represents having somewhat different abilities from a normal character with this class. There is one other way to multiclass, but it isn\u2019t free. The Guild Initiation feat models a character who is particularly committed to an organization, ideal, or patron, and at some point goes through a process of fundamental change. At the level your character takes this feat, your character loses a track and gains a new track, rewriting the previously acquired features of the sacrificed track with the features of the new track. This process can be used to even gain the features of a racial track, but grants only the track features and does not change overall class statistics or racial traits.",

Using a lower array like this one could help create such a game; of course, we must emphasize that this kind of decision should only be made by an entire group, not unilaterally.

Every time a character gains a level, the level offers a new track feature: a unique capability that can dramatically alter the outcome of an encounter. In Legend, we expect characters at different levels to interact with and affect the world around them in different ways. 1st through 5th level characters generally have capabilities that are fairly reasonable for ordinary humans (aside from magic abilities, of course). But characters at higher levels are legendary heroes or demigods. When designing your character, you should consider your character\u2019s starting level and prepare to face enemies of appropriate power and capability. Some of the relevant considerations follow: Between 5th and 10th level, abilities like medium-range teleportation and flight become extremely common. As characters reach the higher end of that level range, you need to either have special movement abilities or the ability to attack creatures who use them (usually by having a ranged weapon or offensive magic). Around this same level, many characters also gain innate healing and abilities that can affect many opponents at once. Characters in this level range can\u2019t take on an army of ordinary humans, but they can break that army with careful tactics and piecemeal engagements.  Between 11th level and 15th level, creatures can access [Death] abilities \u2013 attacks that do massive damage and can cripple or kill a character outright. Long-range teleportation and other \u201cfast travel\u201d abilities appear, and many creatures gain immunities to certain attacks and abilities. Knowledge checks and divinatory abilities become quite important to reveal what an opponent can do and how an opponent can be effectively harmed. Creatures in this level range can attack an entire army of ordinary humans without being seriously harmed, and often a single survivor of an adventuring party can find a way to resurrect fallen comrades with a little effort.  From 16th level on, many creatures become extremely difficult to kill. At this level, characters approach deific power. Creatures can often ignore a round\u2019s worth of attacks outright, or survive otherwise-deadly attacks, or even spontaneously revive if killed once. Many characters also dramatically improve their offensive abilities. Characters in this level range are barely even threatened by an army of ordinary humans.  Beyond 20th level, you're dealing with a pack of roving demi-gods. Prepare for that.",

Do you want them to grow meaningfully in the course of a quest? As the result of a great revelation? As part of a soul-searching moment before the big fight? In general, we certainly recommend that players level up once per [Quest] or per plot arc, but this might not mesh well with the flow of your story, and you may have trouble with the flow of the campaign versus the flow of time in real life. A set experience progression leaves you with relatively fewer good mechanisms of recourse, which was the core motivation behind our decision that experience was a meta-game construct that didn\u2019t serve us well.  It bears mention, however, that we do think parties should be comprised of characters who are the same level, and much of the math behind Legend is written with this in mind. It\u2019s a view we hold due to the elegance of that situation, and the fact that it decreases player conflict. No one wants to be the runt of the litter, and we have better ways to portray interdependency among characters than to force someone into the life of the side-kick or mascot.",

            "text": "There are a couple of advantages to using a fixed progression, however, and we provide one as an optional framework for running certain kinds of campaigns. One of the big advantages is that it\u2019s visibly and completely impartial. It measures success along a clean and visible metric, which is just a good feeling and a good thing. It also fits pretty well with the Dungeon Crawl, where you\u2019re slicing your way through the legions of evil in pursuit of power and loot. In such a situation, you might want players to be able to choose what parts of a dungeon they work through, in the interest of providing a more open and free roaming experience. Another advantage is being able to portray power as less of a narrative progression. The following is a suggested progression that provides a comparatively fast trip through low levels, a fairly smooth progression through mid-game, and a slower progression through end-game.  For this type of progression, encounters of EL-2 (see Section X) are worth one experience point; encounters of EL-1 are worth two; encounters of EL+0 are worth three; and encounters of EL+1 are worth five. An EL+2 encounter is worth seven points, but is rarely survivable. Encounters outside this range are generally not appropriate challenges. A party gains points for any combat encounter they win, or any combat encounter they obviate through non-combat means. This can include clever escapes at the GM\u2019s discretion. However, if the party resolves an encounter without fighting, they only gain experience for the creatures they interacted with and not for any reinforcements in the background.",
