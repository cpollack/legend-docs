            "text": "Gameplay Basics\n\n\nThe Core Mechanic\n\n\nTo determine if your character succeeds at a task, you roll a twenty-sided die, referred to elsewhere in this book as a \u201cd20\u201d. A roll of 20 is not an automatic success, nor is a roll of 1 an automatic failure. Compare your result to a target number (\u201cDifficulty Class\u201d, or DC, when making a skill check or saving throw, and \u201cArmor Class\u201d, or AC, when making an attack). If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.\n\n\nDice\n\n\nDice rolls are described with expressions such as \u201c3d4+5,\u201d which means \u201croll three four-sided dice and add 5\u201d (resulting in a number between 8 and 17). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the \u201cd\u201d tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result, which is called the modifier.\n\n\nd%\n\n\nPercentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100. If the result of the roll is under the required percentage chance (for example, if there is a 20% chance of something happening and you roll a 13) then the event takes place.\n\n\nTaking 10 and 20\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t always make sense for actions to carry a random element. When you are not in any danger or otherwise distracted, you may \u201ctake 10\u201d \u2013 treat a roll of a d20 as a 10 (the average) instead of rolling, to represent an average result. If you have lots of spare time and the action you are attempting carries no consequences for failing (such as straining to open a tight jar) you may treat the result of a d20 roll as a 20, but doing this means that the action takes 20 times as long as normal. In effect, it\u2019s assumed that you\u2019ve rolled the die 20 times until an actual 20 came up. Ultimately, the GM decides when you are permitted to take 10 or 20. Some tracks and feats grant abilities that may allow you to \u201ctake\u201d other values.\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Math\n\n\nOften, you may be required to divide a number to determine the numeric value of an ability or effect (such as a feat that adds one half your character level to damage). Whenever your result for any division is fractional, round down to the nearest whole number, even if the fraction was larger than \u00bd. For example, if a character added \u00bd of his level to damage, and he was level 7, he would only add 3 damage (even though half of his level would be 3\u00bd)\n\n\n\n\nModifiers\n\n\nA modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll or value. A positive modifier is a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty. In most cases, modifiers to a given check, roll, or value stack (combine for a cumulative effect) if they come from different sources and have different types (or no type at all), but do not stack if they have the same type or come from the same source (such as the same spell cast twice in succession). If the modifiers to a particular check, roll, or value do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies.\n\n\nAbility Modifier\n\n\nThe bonus or penalty associated with a particular ability score. Ability modifiers apply to checks, rolls, and values for character actions involving the corresponding abilities.\n\n\nCircumstance Modifier\n\n\nA circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors impacting the success of the task at hand, such as the presence of precisely crafted tools in a workshop. Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from essentially the same source. Circumstance modifiers are, of course, determined entirely by the GM.\n\n\nDeflection Bonus\n\n\nA deflection bonus is an increase to Armor Class caused by physical or supernatural increases in a character\u2019s ability to block and redirect incoming attacks. Deflection bonuses are typically provided by magical shields and by some track abilities that increase Armor Class.\n\n\nFeat Bonus\n\n\nA bonus granted because of a feat chosen by a particular creature. Feat bonuses do not stack with each other.\n\n\nFury Bonus\n\n\nA bonus granted by track abilities that are magnified by emotional or psychological imbalance. ury bonuses stack with other fury bonuses from the same track, but never stack with fury bonuses from other tracks. At the beginning of your turn, you may choose not to benefit from fury bonuses to attack rolls, damage, and save DCs until the beginning of your next turn. Attacks and abilities that benefit from a fury bonus to attack rolls, damage or save DCs cannot also deal [Precision] damage.\n\n\nItem Modifier\n\n\nAn item bonus or penalty is typically derived from an item in a creature\u2019s possession. Only one item bonus and one item penalty can ever be applied at a time to a given roll, check, or value.\n\n\nRacial Bonus\n\n\nA bonus granted because of innate characteristics of that type of creature. If a creature\u2019s race changes, it loses all racial bonuses it had in its previous form.\n\n\nSize Modifier\n\n\nA size bonus or penalty is derived from a creature\u2019s size category. Size modifiers of different kinds apply to Armor Class, attack rolls, and various other checks.\n\n\nUntyped Modifier\n\n\nA bonus or penalty that is not given a specific type stacks with all other bonuses and penalties, including other untyped modifiers, as long as the various untyped modifiers don\u2019t come from the same source (such as casting a spell on yourself twice).\n\n\nAbility Scores\n\n\nThe six ability scores determine the very basics of your character \u2013 how strong he is, how fast he is, how smart he is, and so forth.\n\n\nAbility Modifiers\n\n\nEach ability has a modifier, usually ranging from -5 to +5 at character generation. The table below (\u201cAbility Modifiers and Bonus Spells\u201d)  shows the modifier for each score. It also shows bonus spells, which you\u2019ll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.\n\n\nThe modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren\u2019t die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty. To calculate an ability score modifier, subtract 10 from the score, then divide the remainder by 2, rounding down.\n\n\nKey Ability Modifiers\n\n\nEach character class has two Key Ability Modifiers \u2013 a Key Offensive Modifier (KOM) and Key Defensive Modifier (KDM). KOM is used to calculate their combat skill in making attacks rolls (attack bonus) and striking down foes (damage on weapon attacks). KDM measures their skill at surviving damage (hit points) and protecting against attacks (Armor Class).\n\n\nIf a character\u2019s KDM changes, the character\u2019s hit points also increase or decrease accordingly. The KOM and KDM can never be the same ability modifier.\n\n\nSpellcasting Ability Modifiers\n\n\nEach spellcasting track has its own Spellcasting Ability Modifier (SAM) which is used to calculate DCs for their spells and determine if the character receives any additional spells besides those allotted by default.\n\n\nCharacters with a spellcasting track may receive additional spells per [Scene] if their Spellcasting Ability Modifier for that track is exceptionally high (see table 2-1). Additional spells of a circle that a character cannot otherwise cast are not gained.\n\n\nTable 2-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifier\n\n\nCircle 1\n\n\nCircle 2\n\n\nCircle 3\n\n\nCircle 4\n\n\nCircle 5\n\n\nCircle 6\n\n\nCircle 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 > n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Abilities\n\n\nEach ability partially describes your character and affects some of his or her actions.\n\n\nStrength (Dex)\n\n\nStrength is a physical ability that measures your character\u2019s muscle and physical power.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Strength modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nFortitude saving throws (if your Strength is equal to or higher than your Constitution).\n\n\nSkills that have Strength as their key ability.\n\n\nYour attacks gain a bonus to damage equal to half your Strength modifier (if positive).\n\n\n\n\nDexterity (Dex)\n\n\nDexterity is a physical ability that measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Dexterity modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nInitiative checks to determine who acts first in a combat encounter.\n\n\nReflex saving throws (if your Dexterity is equal to or higher than your Intelligence).\n\n\nSkills that have Dexterity as their key ability.\n\n\n\n\nConstitution (Con)\n\n\nConstitution is a physical ability that represents your character\u2019s vitality, stamina, and durability.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Constitution modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nFortitude saving throws (if your Constitution is equal to or higher than your Strength).\n\n\nSkills that have Constitution as their key ability.\n\n\nYou gain [Damage reduction] equal to half your Constitution modifier (if positive).\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence (Int)\n\n\nIntelligence is a mental ability that determines how well your character learns and reasons.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Intelligence modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nReflex saving throws (if your Intelligence is higher than your Dexterity).\n\n\nSkills that have Intelligence as their key ability.\n\n\n\n\nWisdom (Wis)\n\n\nWisdom is a mental ability that describes a character\u2019s willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one\u2019s ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one\u2019s surroundings.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Wisdom modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nWill saving throws (if your Wisdom is equal to or higher than your Charisma).\n\n\nSkills that have Wisdom as their key ability.\n\n\nThe Awareness defense.\n\n\n\n\nCharisma (Cha)\n\n\nCharisma is a mental ability that measures a character\u2019s force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, and ability to lead. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social Setting.\n\n\nYou apply your character\u2019s Charisma modifier to:\n\n\n\n\nWill saving throws (if your Charisma is higher than your Wisdom).\n\n\nSkills that have Charisma as their key ability.\n\n\n\n\nWhen an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly.\n\n\nSecondary Statistics\n\n\nAside from ability scores, all creatures have a set of statistics that represent their basic ability to deal and evade damage. These numbers increase as creatures increase in power through gaining levels.\n\n\nThe secondary statistics are Armor Class, Hit Points, Base Attack Bonus, and Fortitude, Reflex, and Will base saving throw bonuses. All creatures also have some capacity of noticing things others don\u2019t want them to, which is represented by the Awareness defense.\n\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\n\nArmor Class, measures a character\u2019s skill at evading physical attacks.\n\n\n\n\nYou calculate AC as follows: \n10 + level + KDM + misc. modifiers\n.\n\n\n\n\nHit points (HP)\n\n\nHit points measure a character\u2019s overall combat endurance. Your HP largely depend on your class; each class offers 8, 10, or 12 hit points, plus your KDM, per level, with twice as many HP at 1st level. For example, a 1st-level barbarian with Constitution 16 would have 26 HP (10 class HP, plus a Constitution KDM of 3, doubled for 1st level). At 2nd level, that same barbarian would have 39 HP.\n\n\n\n\nYou calculate HP as follows: \n(Class HP + KDM) * (level + 1) + misc. modifiers\n.\n\n\n\n\nBase Attack Bonus (BAB)\n\n\nBase Attack Bonus measures a character\u2019s basic skill at combat. It increases at one of two different rates, depending on a character\u2019s class, as detailed on table 2-2 (\u201cBase Attack Bonus\u201d).\n\n\nYou use BAB to calculate an attack roll against an enemy, as follows: 1d20 + BAB + your character\u2019s Key Offensive Modifier + any other applicable modifiers. Whenever you make an attack roll, if the result equals or exceeds the target\u2019s Armor Class, the attack hits that target.\n\n\nWhen they take an attack action, characters with a BAB of +6 or higher gain one or more extra attacks, albeit made with a lower attack bonus, as shown on table 2-2. The values given on racial track and class tables in this document only list full BAB; the lower bonus for additional attacks is extrapolated using table 2-2.\n\n\n\n\nCalculating To-Hit: \n1d20 + BAB + KOM + misc. modifiers\n.\n\n\n\n\nBase Attack Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nGood\n\n\nPoor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n6 / 1\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n7 / 2\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n8 / 3\n\n\n6 / 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n9 / 4\n\n\n6 / 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n10 / 5\n\n\n7 / 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n11 / 6 x 2\n\n\n8 / 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n12 / 7 x 2\n\n\n9 / 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n13 / 8 x 2\n\n\n9 / 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n14 / 9 x 2\n\n\n10 / 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n15 / 10 x 2\n\n\n11 / 6 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n16 / 11 x 3\n\n\n12 / 7 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n17 / 12 x 3\n\n\n12 / 7 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n18 / 13 x 3\n\n\n13 / 8 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n19 / 14 x 3\n\n\n14 / 9 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n20 / 15 x 3\n\n\n15 / 10 x 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n21 / 16 x 4\n\n\n16 / 11 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n22 / 17 x 4\n\n\n17 / 12 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n23 / 18 x 4\n\n\n18 / 13 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n24 / 19 x 4\n\n\n18 / 13 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n25 / 20 x 4\n\n\n19 / 14 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n26 / 21 x 5\n\n\n20 / 15 x 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n27 / 22 x 5\n\n\n21 / 16 x 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n28 / 23 x 5\n\n\n21 / 16 x 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n29 / 24 x 5\n\n\n22 / 17 x 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n30 / 25 x 5\n\n\n23 / 18 x 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwareness\n\n\nAwareness is your character\u2019s general ability to notice when someone else is trying to perform an action while remaining unnoticed. You calculate Awareness as follows: 10 + your level + your character\u2019s Wisdom modifier + any other applicable modifiers.\n\n\nSaving Throws\n\n\nSaving throw bonuses are used to calculate \u201csaving throws\u201d or \u201csaves,\u201d which are d20 rolls made to resist particular types of abilities. Abilities that require a save specify the type of save required, but a general guide for what saves resist which types of effect is given below. You can make a saving throw against an effect whenever it would specifically allow you to, or whenever that effect would affect you differently on a successful save. Unless otherwise specified, you can only make a single save against each individual effect. Saving throw bonuses are based on a character\u2019s level and choice of class, and are given in the table for a character\u2019s chosen class. A save succeeds if its result equals or exceeds a listed Difficulty Class (DC), which is always given in the text of the ability or effect that triggers the save. You may always decline to make a save against an effect that triggers a save. This is treated as failing the save for that effect.\n\n\nFortitude\n\n\nFortitude (Fort) is a character\u2019s ability to resist effects that eat away at that character\u2019s physical body or crush it outright, such as poison or a cartoonishly impractical anvil. You calculate Fortitude as follows: 1d20 + your base Fortitude bonus + the higher of your Strength and Constitution modifiers + any other applicable modifiers.\n\n\nReflex\n\n\nReflex (Ref) is a character\u2019s ability to dodge area effects, such as explosions, as well as most traps. You calculate Reflex as follows: 1d20 + your base Reflex bonus + the higher of your Dexterity and Intelligence modifiers + any other applicable modifiers.\n\n\nWill\n\n\nWill is a character\u2019s ability to resist assaults on the mind, such as scary things or mind control. You calculate Will as follows: 1d20 + your base Will bonus + the higher of your Wisdom and Charisma modifiers + any other applicable modifiers.",

If you are playing a one-shot or a similar brief game, and only require enough information to fill out a character sheet, you can use the Quick Start Guide to generate a character. If you are playing a longer game, you may wish to devote a little more time and effort to developing a character concept and finding the mechanical abilities that best support it.\n\n\nQuick Start Guide\n\n\nTo create a character quickly, follow these steps:\n\n\n1. Choose a Race\n\n\nChoose a race from the options detailed in Section IV.\n\n\n2. Choose a Class\n\n\nChoose a class from Section V.  If you have to make choices associated with your tracks (such as spell selection or choosing between different tracks for which you\u2019re eligible), make them now and write your tracks and track abilities down on your character sheet.\n\n\n3. Assign Ability Scores\n\n\nThe default ability scores in Legend are 16, 14, 14, 12, 10, and 10. Assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, in the order you prefer. In general, it is best to assign high scores to your character\u2019s Key Abilities, since those are the abilities on which your character most relies in a broad variety of situations.\n\n\nIf you are creating a higher-level character, consult table 3-2 (\u201cCharacter Advancement\u201d) and increase your character\u2019s ability scores by the amounts given for a character of the appropriate level.\n\n\nFor example, a 7th-level barbarian with the Rage track might choose to increase Strength by +4 and Constitution by +2, and could increase any other ability score by +2 as well.\n\n\n4. Note Your Class Skills\n\n\nYour class skills are those skills that all members of your class are generally adept at.  They can be found listed with your class.  You gain a bonus equal to one-half your level on all skill checks using a class skill, as explained in Section VII.\n\n\n5. Choose Your Trained Skills\n\n\nChoose skills from Section VII.  The number of skills available to the class you chose is noted at the top of your class. The skills you choose are considered \u201ctrained\u201d. You gain a bonus equal to one-half your level on all skill checks using trained skills, as explained in Section VII.  The bonus from training stacks with the bonus from a skill being considered a class skill.\n\n\n6. Choose Your Feats\n\n\nChoose feats for your character from Section VIII. A first-level character has two feat slots, one of which must be chosen from the bonus feat for your character\u2019s race, as explained in Section IV.\n\n\nIf you are building a higher-level character, choose additional feats at the levels shown on table 3-2.\n\n\n7. Choose Your Items\n\n\nChoose items for your character from Section XIII. A 1st character may have a reasonable number of mundane items and a single Lesser item. You gain the ability to use additional magic items as noted on table 3-2 (\u201cCharacter Advancement\u201d); choose as many additional magic items as you can use, per the table. As explained in Section XIII, you are not limited in your choice of mundane items except by your character concept; consult with your group if you are unclear on this point.\n\n\nUnless your character is a spellcaster or otherwise has a wide range of offensive options, you should generally select a broad variety of weapons (including both ranged and melee weapons). If you\u2019re a higher-level character (5th level or higher), it is also generally wise to ensure your character is able to quickly move around the battlefield, via flight, teleportation, and similar abilities.\n\n\n8. Fill in the Blanks\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t written down or added up anything on your character sheet (such as your character\u2019s Base Attack Bonus, saving throw bonuses, or other numerical values), put it down now. You\u2019ve already made the important choices in building your character, so you should be able to fill in the rest of the numbers without any trouble.\n\n\nAdvanced Character Creation\n\n\nIf you\u2019re playing in a long campaign, or have already selected a character concept that isn\u2019t covered by the standard races or classes, you may wish to put a little more effort into your character than is involved in following the quick start rules. Legend offers a great many character options that don\u2019t appear in the default races and classes. If you want to learn to use these options, look no further.\n\n\nFirst, though, let\u2019s look briefly at character concepts. It\u2019s perfectly alright to flesh out your character with a cool feat you just stumbled across or a couple of items you wanted to try, but it\u2019s usually helpful to start character generation with a pretty good idea of what you want your character to do. Some suggestions follow.\n\n\nCharacter Concepts\n\n\nThe first step in developing a character concept is thinking of a tag line. This can be a description of your character\u2019s profession (\u201cInterstellar Smuggler\u201d or \u201cUndersized Burglar\u201d) or social position (\u201cLong-lost King of a Great City\u201d). Other idea that have worked well in the past include \u201c\u2018Wizard\u2019 on the Run,\u201d \u201cBearer of Stormbringer,\u201d \u201cCheerleader Who Kills Vampires,\u201d and \u201cWizard Private Eye.\u201d\n\n\nOnce you have a tag-line that you expect to hold your interest for the duration of a Legend campaign, start asking yourself a few questions about your character. Usually, your tag line will give you some sense of your character\u2019s race and possibly a few clues to answering these questions.\n\n\n\u201cWhat does my character want?\u201d This probably won\u2019t get you much mechanically, but knowing your character\u2019s greatest motivations might give you a clue of how your character goes about getting them. A character that is admittedly just in it for the money is going to make different life choices from a character that is out to do the right thing and help the helpless. Even if the answer doesn\u2019t help you at all in picking abilities for your character, it\u2019ll pay off in a big way in getting plot hooks for your GM and helping you make decisions in-character.\n\n\n\u201cWhat does my character fear?\u201d This question is pretty good for building a backstory, but it also offers some really rich options for mechanical choices. For example, someone who fears harm coming to his or her friends might focus on learning to protect them, perhaps with the paladin\u2019s Virtue track.\n\n\n\u201cHow does my character resolve conflicts?\u201d Any good story is centered on a basic conflict, and RPGs tend to include a few dozen extra conflicts for good measure. If your character doesn\u2019t end up in fights, chances are you\u2019ll find social confrontations, environmental hazards, or similarly threatening situations. Ability tracks in Legend offers a broad range of abilities for solving or ending confrontations, and your answers to this question might point you to the right ones.\n\n\n\u201cHow does my character make a living?\u201d Most RPG characters aren\u2019t conventionally employed, especially if your game world is a medieval fantasy setting where wage labor doesn\u2019t exist. Still, your character probably has some things that he or she is good at \u2013 maybe even extremely good at. RPG characters tend to be skilled in at least a few useful areas, such as arcane knowledge, investigative and social skills, or physical speed and agility. Your answers here will tell you a great deal about your character\u2019s skill selection.\n\n\n\u201cWhat special tricks does my character keep handy?\u201d This question will help you select feats, particularly [Iconic] feats. It may also help you select a specialized track, such as several of the rogue tracks in Section V.\n\n\nRace Selection\n\n\nUsually, you\u2019ll have some idea of your character\u2019s race by now. If not, you can find the default races in Section IV, as well as a number of additional races in Section VI. If your group is using supplemental material as well, you may have even more options. For the most part, picking a race is purely a matter of taste, as most races can fit a wide range of\n\n\ncharacter archetypes. Some races, however, represent unusual creatures, such as powerful undead creatures, intelligent constructs, or even dragons. In cases where your race includes dramatic, scaling abilities (such as the undead powers of a lich), your race will have a track associated with it. All members of that race have the associated track, and you will have to incorporate that track in your track selection.\n\n\nClass and Track Selection\n\n\nSelecting your class and associated tracks is the single most critical part of character generation, mechanically speaking. If you already have a default class picked out, then you can move on. However, you may want to customize your class at the very least, and choosing a race with an associated track makes this section obligatory.\n\n\nThe classes described in Section V each contain three \u201ctracks\u201d\u2013 progressions of abilities that define much of your character\u2019s mechanical role. Each class also has a set of statistics, such as the number of hit points per level that it grants and the saving throw and attack bonus progressions it offers (you can find this information in the class descriptions, or compiled in the table below).\n\n\nThere are three options for customizing your character\u2019s tracks: a racial track, multiclassing, and Full Buy-In.\n\n\nRacial Tracks\n\n\nAs described above, racial tracks model the abilities of certain powerful creatures, such as dragons, vampires, and angels. These are creatures whose powers are at least partly a facet of their nature; some dragons breathe fire and others rely on clawing your face off, but all of them are flying reptilian creatures who can take a lot of punishment, live a long time, and collect anything valuable they can get their claws on. These are sufficiently iconic and important to justify attaching them automatically to anything calling itself a dragon (unless you\u2019re a Chinese dragon, in which case you would choose a different track). Since racial tracks are a fundamental aspect of how your character interacts with the world, they include a full set of class statistics, including hit points, saving throw and attack bonus progressions, and key ability modifiers. If you have a racial track, choose any class, then two tracks from that class. Treat this combination of tracks and class statistics as your character\u2019s class. Your two chosen tracks retain their progressions from the chosen class, and your racial track gains the progression not used by either of the other tracks. You can multiclass from that class just as if you had a standard class, except that you can\u2019t trade out your racial track.\n\n\nMulticlassing\n\n\nAs explained above, tracks are the building blocks of characters. So if you want to create a \u201chybrid\u201d character like the ranger/rogue of times past, you simply trade a track of \u201cranger\u201d abilities you feel are less important for a track of \u201crogue\u201d abilities.\n\n\nYou can always trade one such track for free, and you can trade another track out with the Guild Initiation feat (more on that in a moment).\n\n\nWhen you multiclass, you select a single track from either another class or from one of the many additional tracks available (excluding racial tracks) and replace one of your default tracks with it. You gain the features of your new track at the same levels you would have gained the features of the track that was replaced. You cannot gain any track more than once. Some tracks are part of the same overall track, and therefore you cannot have more than one of them for any reason. For example, the three options for the rogue\u2019s Offensive Track are mutually exclusive, as with the rogue\u2019s Defensive Track options, the ranger\u2019s Daggers and Bolts options, the barbarian\u2019s Path of War options, and the Sage\u2019s Wrath options.\n\n\nWhen finding a multiclassing track, note that some tracks represent different ways of doing the same thing and therefore aren\u2019t meant to work well together. For example, the Rage, Assassin, and Discipline of the Serpent tracks are all meant to provide characters with a way to do a great deal of damage while fighting, but each models a different style of fighting (a barbarian\u2019s berserk destruction, a hit man\u2019s surprise attacks from the shadows, and a martial artist\u2019s fast and precise striking combinations). In general, if you see that one track\u2019s features are tagged as not stacking with another track\u2019s features, avoid combining them.\n\n\nSome tracks are associated with a particular ability score and function based on that ability. For example, spellcasting tracks are associated with a particular mental ability, while the effectiveness of the Demo Man track will depend on the character\u2019s Intelligence. The Multiclass Flexibility feat allows you to adapt the DCs of a single track\u2019s features to be based on a different ability (with certain limitations) in order to make that track work better for your character. In some cases, you should simply consider whether your character is best off with a track that doesn\u2019t fit with the key abilities you had in mind, or whether it makes more sense for your character to pursue the same basic goal in a different way.\n\n\nLegend classes are typically built to have one track that is largely offensive in nature, one that offers some defense or utility, and one that can be either offensive or defensive but tends to make the class somewhat unique in its playstyle and archetype. When deciding which original track to replace, it\u2019s often wise to consider the kind of role that your new track will play. It\u2019s not necessarily \u201cwrong\u201d to end up with three offensively-oriented tracks, but it does mean that your character will be focused almost exclusively on offense and will largely lack defensive abilities. If you think you may be in this situation, take a moment to consider whether your character concept supports such a hell-for-leather approach to combat and confrontation. If so, go for it! If not, you may be trying to do one thing several different ways, and you might want to reconsider your track choices.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, you can multiclass once for free at character creation. This simply represents having somewhat different abilities from a normal character with this class. There is one other way to multiclass, but it isn\u2019t free. The Guild Initiation feat models a character who is particularly committed to an organization, ideal, or patron, and at some point goes through a process of fundamental change. At the level your character takes this feat, your character loses a track and gains a new track, rewriting the previously acquired features of the sacrificed track with the features of the new track. This process can be used to even gain the features of a racial track, but grants only the track features and does not change overall class statistics or racial traits.\n\n\nFull Buy-In\n\n\nThe Full Buy-In option involves sacrificing the vast majority of your character\u2019s item progression\n\n\nin exchange for gaining a fourth track. This track can be any multiclassing-eligible track or a racial track, but offers only track abilities and never rewrites class statistics. The revised schedule for item progression, along with the levels at which you gain track features from the fourth track, can be found in Section XIII.\n\n\nAbility Score Selection\n\n\nBy this time, you should know your Key Ability Modifiers and have a very good sense of any other abilities that your character would most value and emphasize. So, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to assign your ability scores. This is, however, a fairly good time to discuss the different methods of generating ability scores in Legend. Your group will decide on one of the following methods, to be used for all player characters in your game (NPCs and monsters generally are designed based on the ability array).\n\n\nAbility Array:\n The default ability scores in Legend are 16, 14, 14, 12, 10, and 10, assigned to whichever abilities you prefer. Legend\u2019s game math is based on this ability array, because it provides a predictable common basis for ability scores.\n\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Standard Array\n\n\nStandard Array: \n16, 14, 14, 12, 10, 10\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe array above reflects an exceptionally gifted creature, who is good at most things and is mediocre in only a couple spots. An array that would reflect a more normal (if still a bit above average) creature might be 14, 12, 12, 10, 10, 8. We believe that most RPG characters are expected to be a bit larger than life, but some groups might want a grittier game in which the player characters are just normal people. Using a lower array like this one could help create such a game; of course, we must emphasize that this kind of decision should only be made by an entire group, not unilaterally. Note that an increase or decrease in the default ability array will tend to make player characters inherently more or less powerful respectively compared to standard monsters and pre-generated NPCs of the same level, and that this shift in power will affect gameplay.\n\n\nPoint Buy\n\n\nIn this version of ability score generation, all scores start at 8. You have a pool of 26 points that you can apply to your scores as you wish, 2 points at a time. You cannot increase a single ability score above 18. Using point buy gives players some flexibility in choosing the ability scores that best suit their character. It is possible to achieve somewhat unusual results with this method, such as creatures with a couple of extremely high ability scores and several very low ability scores, so this method is best used in groups where all the players understand the game mechanics well enough to avoid serious mistakes in allocating ability scores.\n\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Point Buy\n\n\nAll stats start at \n8\n. You have a pool of 26 points, which can be spent \n2\n at a time to increase your stats. You can't spend points to go above \n18\n in any stat.\n\n\n\n\nSkill Selection\n\n\nSkill selection should be pretty easy at this point. If you have a strong character concept and know what ability scores you wish to prioritize, picking skills that correspond with those should be easy. Be sure to pick up any skills that you will need to use your track features effectively.\n\n\nFeat Selection\n\n\nWhen selecting feats, always check for \u201cfeat trees\u201d \u2013 series of two or three feats that each require the previous one \u2013 that you want. If you decide that you want a feat tree, make sure you have the feat slots you need to get it first, before you look for individual feats. Other than that, select feats that give your character something cool to do, offer a new application of a skill you already have, or make your character better at your main character goal.\n\n\n[Iconic]\n feats are special feats that grant a particularly unique power. Your character can only have one, so you will generally want to pick one that really embodies your character concept. It\u2019s particularly important to avoid picking a feat that your character can\u2019t support, such as one with a DC based on an ability modifier your character hasn\u2019t invested in.\n\n\nItem Selection\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to go wrong on items. In general, you should have a weapon or some other item that allows you to win fights, armor or some other item that helps you not be stabbed, and items that make you happy. Some of these don\u2019t even need to be magical; until you\u2019re a mid-level character, it actually isn\u2019t all that important to pick up magical protective gear because you get nearly as much Armor Class bonus from mundane equipment.\n\n\nPolishing Your Character\n\n\nCongratulations! You should have a reasonably competent character now, built on an enjoyable and interesting character concept. You\u2019re done now\u2026right?\n\n\nWrong! Being the smart person you are, you\u2019ve undoubtedly figured out all of this and built a character with a minimum of hassle and reworks. Now, while the other clowns at your gaming table are working out their character missteps and kinks, you have a chance to make your character really shine. This is where you start coming up with your character\u2019s backstory, expanding on the motivations you figured out back when you came up with your character concept to begin with. You can sketch your character, if you\u2019re artistically gifted. You can figure out how your character got to know all the other players\u2019 characters.\n\n\nThe bottom line is, this guide tells you how to fill out your character sheet in a way that won\u2019t cause you any serious embarrassments. Once your character sheet is full, there\u2019s always more you can do to build your character.\n\n\nCreating a Character above 1st level\n\n\nMany games feature characters higher than 1st level, and feature characters who are much more significant in terms of power and capability. To start play with a character higher than 1st level, follow the steps below.\n\n\nAbility Selection\n\n\nAbility scores are generated in the same way when making a 1st level character. Then, consult table 3-2 (\u201cCharacter Advancement\u201d) and increase your ability scores by the amounts given for a character of your level. For example, a 7th-level barbarian with the Rage track would likely choose to increase Strength by +4 and Constitution by +2, and could increase any other score by +2 as well (depending on the specific character).\n\n\nRace, Class, and Skill Selection\n\n\nAll of these are done exactly as if making a 1st level character. Your class choice, as well as any tracks acquired through multiclassing, is the same as a 1st-level character; however, you gain all the abilities possessed by a character of your level, per Section V and Section XIII. You have ranks in your chosen skills equal to your level, as explained in Section VII.\n\n\nFeat Selection\n\n\nChoose a number of feats equal to the number of feat slots given for your level in table 3-2. You must meet all prerequisites for a feat at the level you acquire the slot for that feat (so you can\u2019t put a feat in the level 6 slot if it has a prerequisite of character level 9).\n\n\nSpell Selection\n\n\nChoose the abilities you want your character to possess at every level where you have a choice between different spells, powers, or abilities.\n\n\nItem Selection\n\n\nChoose a set of items, consumables, and other commodities from the list given in Section XIII. Consult table 3-2 to determine what kinds of items you are entitled to, and how many of each kind you can use. Characters who have chosen the Full Buy-In option (see Section XIII) receive many fewer items than normal.\n\n\nTable 3-2: Character Advancement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nFeat\n\n\nMovement Speed\n\n\nAbility 1\n\n\nAbility 2\n\n\nAbility 3\n\n\nAbility 4\n\n\nNew Item Slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+0ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+5ft\n\n\n+2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+5ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n+5ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+10ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n+10ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+10ft\n\n\n+4\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n+15ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+15ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+4\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nRelic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n+15ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+20ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n+20ft\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+20ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n+25ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nRelic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+25ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n+25ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+30ft\n\n\n+8\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n+30ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+8\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+30ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n+35ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+4\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+40ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n+40ft\n\n\n+10\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+40ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+10\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n+45ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+8\n\n\n-\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+45ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+6\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n+45ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+50ft\n\n\n+12\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nRelic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n+50ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n+12\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nLesser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n+50ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+10\n\n\n-\n\n\nGreater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n+55ft\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n+8\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveling Up\n\n\n\u201cLeveling up\u201d is the process your character goes through every time you gain a level. An increase in level is a big deal \u2013 your character gains a powerful new ability, as well as becoming more resilient and skilled. There are a few steps to leveling up a character. You can take these steps in whatever order is most beneficial \u2013 if there is a prerequisite you would meet with one step of the leveling process, you meet that prerequisite at another step of the leveling process even if those steps are \u201cout of order\u201d as listed here.\n\n\nIncrease Hit Points and Saving Throw Bonuses\n\n\nWhenever you level up, your maximum hit points increase by the number given in your character class entry plus your KDM. For example, a barbarian gains 10 hit points plus the barbarian\u2019s Constitution modifier at every new level.\n\n\nWhenever you level up, set your base saving throw bonuses to the values listed on the table for your character class for your new level.\n\n\nIncrease Ability Scores\n\n\nAt some levels, as marked out by table 3-2, your character gains an ability score increase. Increase your chosen ability score now. The four ability score increase progressions must apply to different ability scores, and your choice of assigning a given ability to a given increase progression is permanent. The increases in ability scores are not cumulative. For example, at level 17, your primary ability is +8 higher than it was at level 1, not +20.\n\n\nChoose New Track Feature\n\n\nMany tracks offer a choice between different abilities. If any of your ability tracks for this level offer a choice, pick an ability now. Otherwise, simply make a note of your new track ability. Any benefits that you gain at a certain circle or level are available to characters from that level onward.\n\n\nIncrease Skills\n\n\nIncrease your chosen skills by 1 rank each.\n\n\nChoose New Feat\n\n\nEvery odd level you gain a feat. If your new level is odd, choose a feat.\n\n\nSelect Item\n\n\nAt some levels (as shown on table 3-2), your character gains a new magic item slot (you can possess more magic items than you have slots, but can only attune to as many magic items as you have slots \u2013 see Section XIII). This may happen at level-up, as part of quest rewards, or you may have earned or found the item prior to leveling up.\n\n\nIncrease Movement Speed\n\n\nHigher-level characters become quicker and more mobile. At 2nd level, and at every three levels afterward, your character\u2019s movement speed increases by 5 ft.\n\n\nHigher-level Characters and System Expectations\n\n\nAs characters gain levels in Legend, they gain power. Every time a character gains a level, the level offers a new track feature: a unique capability that can dramatically alter the outcome of an encounter. In Legend, we expect characters at different levels to interact with and affect the world around them in different ways. 1st through 5th level characters generally have capabilities that are fairly reasonable for ordinary humans (aside from magic abilities, of course). But characters at higher levels are legendary heroes or demigods. When designing your character, you should consider your character\u2019s starting level and prepare to face enemies of appropriate power and capability. Some of the relevant considerations follow: Between 5th and 10th level, abilities like medium-range teleportation and flight become extremely common. As characters reach the higher end of that level range, you need to either have special movement abilities or the ability to attack creatures who use them (usually by having a ranged weapon or offensive magic). Around this same level, many characters also gain innate healing and abilities that can affect many opponents at once. Characters in this level range can\u2019t take on an army of ordinary humans, but they can break that army with careful tactics and piecemeal engagements.\n\n\nBetween 11th level and 15th level, creatures can access [Death] abilities \u2013 attacks that do massive damage and can cripple or kill a character outright. Long-range teleportation and other \u201cfast travel\u201d abilities appear, and many creatures gain immunities to certain attacks and abilities. Knowledge checks and divinatory abilities become quite important to reveal what an opponent can do and how an opponent can be effectively harmed. Creatures in this level range can attack an entire army of ordinary humans without being seriously harmed, and often a single survivor of an adventuring party can find a way to resurrect fallen comrades with a little effort.\n\n\nFrom 16th level on, many creatures become extremely difficult to kill. At this level, characters approach deific power. Creatures can often ignore a round\u2019s worth of attacks outright, or survive otherwise-deadly attacks, or even spontaneously revive if killed once. Many characters also dramatically improve their offensive abilities. Characters in this level range are barely even threatened by an army of ordinary humans.\n\n\nBeyond 20th level, you're dealing with a pack of roving demi-gods. Prepare for that.\n\n\nLevel Progression\n\n\nWithin the core canon of Legend, we expect level increases to be handed out at thematically appropriate points by GMs. This is because we don\u2019t know when or how you expect characters to increase in power. Do you want them to grow meaningfully in the course of a quest? As the result of a great revelation? As part of a soul-searching moment before the big fight? In general, we certainly recommend that players level up once per [Quest] or per plot arc, but this might not mesh well with the flow of your story, and you may have trouble with the flow of the campaign versus the flow of time in real life. A set experience progression leaves you with relatively fewer good mechanisms of recourse, which was the core motivation behind our decision that experience was a meta-game construct that didn\u2019t serve us well.\n\n\nIt bears mention, however, that we do think parties should be comprised of characters who are the same level, and much of the math behind Legend is written with this in mind. It\u2019s a view we hold due to the elegance of that situation, and the fact that it decreases player conflict. No one wants to be the runt of the litter, and we have better ways to portray interdependency among characters than to force someone into the life of the side-kick or mascot.\n\n\nOptional Rules for Power Increases\n\n\nThere are a couple of advantages to using a fixed progression, however, and we provide one as an optional framework for running certain kinds of campaigns. One of the big advantages is that it\u2019s visibly and completely impartial. It measures success along a clean and visible metric, which is just a good feeling and a good thing. It also fits pretty well with the Dungeon Crawl, where you\u2019re slicing your way through the legions of evil in pursuit of power and loot. In such a situation, you might want players to be able to choose what parts of a dungeon they work through, in the interest of providing a more open and free roaming experience. Another advantage is being able to portray power as less of a narrative progression. The following is a suggested progression that provides a comparatively fast trip through low levels, a fairly smooth progression through mid-game, and a slower progression through end-game.\n\n\nFor this type of progression, encounters of EL-2 (see Section X) are worth one experience point; encounters of EL-1 are worth two; encounters of EL+0 are worth three; and encounters of EL+1 are worth five. An EL+2 encounter is worth seven points, but is rarely survivable. Encounters outside this range are generally not appropriate challenges. A party gains points for any combat encounter they win, or any combat encounter they obviate through non-combat means. This can include clever escapes at the GM\u2019s discretion. However, if the party resolves an encounter without fighting, they only gain experience for the creatures they interacted with and not for any reinforcements in the background.",

This can be a description of your character\u2019s profession (\u201cInterstellar Smuggler\u201d or \u201cUndersized Burglar\u201d) or social position (\u201cLong-lost King of a Great City\u201d).

Usually, your tag line will give you some sense of your character\u2019s race and possibly a few clues to answering these questions.  \u201cWhat does my character want?\u201d This probably won\u2019t get you much mechanically, but knowing your character\u2019s greatest motivations might give you a clue of how your character goes about getting them. A character that is admittedly just in it for the money is going to make different life choices from a character that is out to do the right thing and help the helpless. Even if the answer doesn\u2019t help you at all in picking abilities for your character, it\u2019ll pay off in a big way in getting plot hooks for your GM and helping you make decisions in-character.  \u201cWhat does my character fear?\u201d This question is pretty good for building a backstory, but it also offers some really rich options for mechanical choices. For example, someone who fears harm coming to his or her friends might focus on learning to protect them, perhaps with the paladin\u2019s Virtue track.  \u201cHow does my character resolve conflicts?\u201d Any good story is centered on a basic conflict, and RPGs tend to include a few dozen extra conflicts for good measure. If your character doesn\u2019t end up in fights, chances are you\u2019ll find social confrontations, environmental hazards, or similarly threatening situations. Ability tracks in Legend offers a broad range of abilities for solving or ending confrontations, and your answers to this question might point you to the right ones.  \u201cHow does my character make a living?\u201d Most RPG characters aren\u2019t conventionally employed, especially if your game world is a medieval fantasy setting where wage labor doesn\u2019t exist. Still, your character probably has some things that he or she is good at \u2013 maybe even extremely good at. RPG characters tend to be skilled in at least a few useful areas, such as arcane knowledge, investigative and social skills, or physical speed and agility. Your answers here will tell you a great deal about your character\u2019s skill selection.  \u201cWhat special tricks does my character keep handy?\u201d This question will help you select feats, particularly [Iconic] feats.

For the most part, picking a race is purely a matter of taste, as most races can fit a wide range of  character archetypes. Some races, however, represent unusual creatures, such as powerful undead creatures, intelligent constructs, or even dragons. In cases where your race includes dramatic, scaling abilities (such as the undead powers of a lich), your race will have a track associated with it.

The classes described in Section V each contain three \u201ctracks\u201d\u2013 progressions of abilities that define much of your character\u2019s mechanical role. Each class also has a set of statistics, such as the number of hit points per level that it grants and the saving throw and attack bonus progressions it offers (you can find this information in the class descriptions, or compiled in the table below).

These are sufficiently iconic and important to justify attaching them automatically to anything calling itself a dragon (unless you\u2019re a Chinese dragon, in which case you would choose a different track). Since racial tracks are a fundamental aspect of how your character interacts with the world, they include a full set of class statistics, including hit points, saving throw and attack bonus progressions, and key ability modifiers. If you have a racial track, choose any class, then two tracks from that class. Treat this combination of tracks and class statistics as your character\u2019s class. Your two chosen tracks retain their progressions from the chosen class, and your racial track gains the progression not used by either of the other tracks.

So if you want to create a \u201chybrid\u201d character like the ranger/rogue of times past, you simply trade a track of \u201cranger\u201d abilities you feel are less important for a track of \u201crogue\u201d abilities.  You can always trade one such track for free, and you can trade another track out with the Guild Initiation feat (more on that in a moment).  When you multiclass, you select a single track from either another class or from one of the many additional tracks available (excluding racial tracks) and replace one of your default tracks with it. You gain the features of your new track at the same levels you would have gained the features of the track that was replaced. You cannot gain any track more than once. Some tracks are part of the same overall track, and therefore you cannot have more than one of them for any reason. For example, the three options for the rogue\u2019s Offensive Track are mutually exclusive, as with the rogue\u2019s Defensive Track options, the ranger\u2019s Daggers and Bolts options, the barbarian\u2019s Path of War options, and the Sage\u2019s Wrath options.  When finding a multiclassing track, note that some tracks represent different ways of doing the same thing and therefore aren\u2019t meant to work well together. For example, the Rage, Assassin, and Discipline of the Serpent tracks are all meant to provide characters with a way to do a great deal of damage while fighting, but each models a different style of fighting (a barbarian\u2019s berserk destruction, a hit man\u2019s surprise attacks from the shadows, and a martial artist\u2019s fast and precise striking combinations). In general, if you see that one track\u2019s features are tagged as not stacking with another track\u2019s features, avoid combining them.  Some tracks are associated with a particular ability score and function based on that ability. For example, spellcasting tracks are associated with a particular mental ability, while the effectiveness of the Demo Man track will depend on the character\u2019s Intelligence. The Multiclass Flexibility feat allows you to adapt the DCs of a single track\u2019s features to be based on a different ability (with certain limitations) in order to make that track work better for your character. In some cases, you should simply consider whether your character is best off with a track that doesn\u2019t fit with the key abilities you had in mind, or whether it makes more sense for your character to pursue the same basic goal in a different way.  Legend classes are typically built to have one track that is largely offensive in nature, one that offers some defense or utility, and one that can be either offensive or defensive but tends to make the class somewhat unique in its playstyle and archetype. When deciding which original track to replace, it\u2019s often wise to consider the kind of role that your new track will play. It\u2019s not necessarily \u201cwrong\u201d to end up with three offensively-oriented tracks, but it does mean that your character will be focused almost exclusively on offense and will largely lack defensive abilities. If you think you may be in this situation, take a moment to consider whether your character concept supports such a hell-for-leather approach to combat and confrontation. If so, go for it! If not, you may be trying to do one thing several different ways, and you might want to reconsider your track choices.  As mentioned above, you can multiclass once for free at character creation. This simply represents having somewhat different abilities from a normal character with this class. There is one other way to multiclass, but it isn\u2019t free. The Guild Initiation feat models a character who is particularly committed to an organization, ideal, or patron, and at some point goes through a process of fundamental change. At the level your character takes this feat, your character loses a track and gains a new track, rewriting the previously acquired features of the sacrificed track with the features of the new track. This process can be used to even gain the features of a racial track, but grants only the track features and does not change overall class statistics or racial traits.",

Using a lower array like this one could help create such a game; of course, we must emphasize that this kind of decision should only be made by an entire group, not unilaterally.

Every time a character gains a level, the level offers a new track feature: a unique capability that can dramatically alter the outcome of an encounter. In Legend, we expect characters at different levels to interact with and affect the world around them in different ways. 1st through 5th level characters generally have capabilities that are fairly reasonable for ordinary humans (aside from magic abilities, of course). But characters at higher levels are legendary heroes or demigods. When designing your character, you should consider your character\u2019s starting level and prepare to face enemies of appropriate power and capability. Some of the relevant considerations follow: Between 5th and 10th level, abilities like medium-range teleportation and flight become extremely common. As characters reach the higher end of that level range, you need to either have special movement abilities or the ability to attack creatures who use them (usually by having a ranged weapon or offensive magic). Around this same level, many characters also gain innate healing and abilities that can affect many opponents at once. Characters in this level range can\u2019t take on an army of ordinary humans, but they can break that army with careful tactics and piecemeal engagements.  Between 11th level and 15th level, creatures can access [Death] abilities \u2013 attacks that do massive damage and can cripple or kill a character outright. Long-range teleportation and other \u201cfast travel\u201d abilities appear, and many creatures gain immunities to certain attacks and abilities. Knowledge checks and divinatory abilities become quite important to reveal what an opponent can do and how an opponent can be effectively harmed. Creatures in this level range can attack an entire army of ordinary humans without being seriously harmed, and often a single survivor of an adventuring party can find a way to resurrect fallen comrades with a little effort.  From 16th level on, many creatures become extremely difficult to kill. At this level, characters approach deific power. Creatures can often ignore a round\u2019s worth of attacks outright, or survive otherwise-deadly attacks, or even spontaneously revive if killed once. Many characters also dramatically improve their offensive abilities. Characters in this level range are barely even threatened by an army of ordinary humans.  Beyond 20th level, you're dealing with a pack of roving demi-gods. Prepare for that.",

Do you want them to grow meaningfully in the course of a quest? As the result of a great revelation? As part of a soul-searching moment before the big fight? In general, we certainly recommend that players level up once per [Quest] or per plot arc, but this might not mesh well with the flow of your story, and you may have trouble with the flow of the campaign versus the flow of time in real life. A set experience progression leaves you with relatively fewer good mechanisms of recourse, which was the core motivation behind our decision that experience was a meta-game construct that didn\u2019t serve us well.  It bears mention, however, that we do think parties should be comprised of characters who are the same level, and much of the math behind Legend is written with this in mind. It\u2019s a view we hold due to the elegance of that situation, and the fact that it decreases player conflict.

One of the big advantages is that it\u2019s visibly and completely impartial. It measures success along a clean and visible metric, which is just a good feeling and a good thing. It also fits pretty well with the Dungeon Crawl, where you\u2019re slicing your way through the legions of evil in pursuit of power and loot. In such a situation, you might want players to be able to choose what parts of a dungeon they work through, in the interest of providing a more open and free roaming experience. Another advantage is being able to portray power as less of a narrative progression. The following is a suggested progression that provides a comparatively fast trip through low levels, a fairly smooth progression through mid-game, and a slower progression through end-game.  For this type of progression, encounters of EL-2 (see Section X) are worth one experience point; encounters of EL-1 are worth two; encounters of EL+0 are worth three; and encounters of EL+1 are worth five. An EL+2 encounter is worth seven points, but is rarely survivable. Encounters outside this range are generally not appropriate challenges. A party gains points for any combat encounter they win, or any combat encounter they obviate through non-combat means. This can include clever escapes at the GM\u2019s discretion. However, if the party resolves an encounter without fighting, they only gain experience for the creatures they interacted with and not for any reinforcements in the background.",

Carefully consider individual bonuses or penalties of greater than 2 (such as a +4 bonus and a -2 penalty), because they can cause unusual repercussions for a character at low levels. An individual bonus or penalty should never be greater than 4.\n\n\nSecond, select a list of 3 thematically appropriate feats that have no minimum level prerequisite or a minimum level prerequisite of 3rd or lower. Be careful when selecting powerful combat-related feats, as those can often unbalance the game if they are accessed too early. If the race you are creating is cosmopolitan or unusually diverse, it may be more fitting to give it a feat of \u201cAny\u201d, with the restriction that this feat slot cannot be spent on any feat that requires the character to be higher than level 1.\n\n\nThird, give the race a thematically appropriate ability from the following list:\n\n Special vision mode (such as [Darkvision] or [Ghostwise sight]);\n\n Fast movement (an increase in base movement of 5 ft from the default);\n\n The Swim movement mode;\n\n +1 bonus to attack rolls;\n\n +1 bonus to Armor Class;\n\n +1 bonus to a single type of saving throw.\n\n\nFourth, give the race another thematically appropriate ability from the following list:\n\n +2 bonus (increasing by 1 every 8 levels) to a single thematically appropriate skill; \n\n +1 bonus to attack rolls;\n\n +1 bonus to Armor Class;\n\n +1 bonus to a single type of saving throw.\n\n\nIf you find it necessary to mechanically model hybrid races in your game, we suggest following the rules for creating a race while selecting racial ability modifiers, special abilities, and bonus feat lists that reflect a hybridization of two different races.",

An individual bonus or penalty should never be greater than 4.  Second, select a list of 3 thematically appropriate feats that have no minimum level prerequisite or a minimum level prerequisite of 3rd or lower. Be careful when selecting powerful combat-related feats, as those can often unbalance the game if they are accessed too early.

Third, give the race a thematically appropriate ability from the following list:  Special vision mode (such as [Darkvision] or [Ghostwise sight]);  Fast movement (an increase in base movement of 5 ft from the default);  The Swim movement mode;  +1 bonus to attack rolls;  +1 bonus to Armor Class;  +1 bonus to a single type of saving throw.  Fourth, give the race another thematically appropriate ability from the following list:  +2 bonus (increasing by 1 every 8 levels) to a single thematically appropriate skill;   +1 bonus to attack rolls;  +1 bonus to Armor Class;  +1 bonus to a single type of saving throw.

            "text": "Class\n\n\nA class defnes a major part of how your character solves problems. Whenever you create a character in Legend, you start by selecting a character class. Your class grants a collection of three ability tracks, plus a \u201cschedule\u201d of when you gain the abilities for each. Unless you multiclass (see below), you progress the three tracks of your character class throughout your adventuring career. A class is not a job \u2013 a barbarian and paladin might both make a living as a knight, a trader, or a sushi chef.\n\n\nAbility Tracks\n\n\nThe classes in this book progress on a set of ability tracks. Each track generally grants an ability every three levels. These tracks are designed to be roughly balanced in terms of power, compared to other tracks, and form the core of the Legend multiclassing system. Each class progresses 3 tracks as the set of class features that they provide to a character.\n\n\nTracks provide 7 abilities over a character\u2019s progression. We classify these abilities by their \u201ccircle\u201d \u2013 the point in the track at which the ability becomes available. So all abilities, whether they are extraordinary, supernatural, spell-like, or spell abilities, have a \u201ccircle\u201d (from first to seventh). This is particularly critical for spells and spell-like abilities, since their circle determines how easily they can be dispelled.\n\n\nThere are several classes in this system \u2013 barbarian, paladin, sage, shaman, ranger and rogue\n\u2013 that have numbers for track progression but do not have specifc tracks named. This is because each class has multiple tracks available, for purposes of increased customization. This does not represent an increase in overall power, because track choices are permanent; it simply represents an increase in variety.\n\n\nAbility tracks based on spellcasting grant access to new circles of spells on a specifc spell list, detailed at the end of the class using that spell list. Full details of each spell, along with specifc rules for using spells, can be found in Section XII.\n\n\nAbility Track Progressions\n\n\nAll player characters have at least three tracks.\nThese three tracks follow three different progressions, staggered so that each character level gained grants at least one new ability. The progressions are called Fast, Medium, and Slow, and are detailed below. A character using the Full Buy-In option (see Section XIII) gains a fourth track that follows the Medium progression.\n\n\n\n\nFast Progression: Receives circle abilities at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level.\n\n\nMedium Progression: Receives circle abilities at 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th level.\n\n\nSlow Progression: Receives circle abilities at 2nd, 5th, 8th,  11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th level.\n\n\n\n\nTracks do not have an innate progression \u2013 progression speed is always determined by the multiclassing choices of the individual character. For example, while the Path of War track is normally in a Medium progression for barbarians, a multiclass character that trades away a Slow progression track for Path of War would advance Path of War circles in accordance with the Slow progression.\n\n\nMulticlassing\n\n\nPlayers who have a character concept in mind that doesn\u2019t quite ft in any single class may multiclass. Multiclassing is done by trading a single ability track from a player\u2019s chosen class in exchange for gaining an ability track from another class or from a list of bonus tracks contained in Section VI.\n\n\nSome ability tracks (such as the paladin\u2019s Judgment and the rogue\u2019s Esoterica Radica) cannot be accessed by multiclassing. Such restrictions are always included in the text of an ability track.\n\n\nSome other tracks may include prerequisites (such as race, a feat, another track, or a minimum in an ability score). You can never multiclass into a track for which you lack a prerequisite.\n\n\nTo multiclass, simply choose to multiclass at character generation. You can substitute one\ntrack in this way, with no associated costs. This substitution represents characters who begin their careers as multiclassed \u201chybrid\u201d characters, and therefore can only be done at 1st level (or, if the game begins at a higher level, at character generation). \nYou may not multiclass into a racial track.\n\n\nThe Guild Initiation feat represents characters who decide to change their life paths later on, and pursue training, a ritual or magical procedure that can replace existing track features with the abilities of a new track. The new track from Guild Initiation can replace either a standard track (listed as part of your standard class features) or a multiclass track.\n\n\nWhen you gain a new track via multiclassing, you pick one of your class\u2019s tracks and give up\nthat track. You instead gain the circles of the new track, in order, at the levels that you would have gained features from the sacrifced track. You cannot gain any track more than once.\n\n\nSome tracks are part of the same overall track, and therefore you cannot have more than one of them for any reason. For example, the three options for the Rogue\u2019s O\ufb00ensive Track are mutually exclusive, as with the Rogue\u2019s Defensive Track options, the Ranger\u2019s Daggers and Bolts options, the Sage\u2019s Wrath options, and the Barbarian\u2019s Path of War options.\n\n\nSome tracks, including most rogue tracks and some barbarian tracks, change the Key Ability\nModifer of any character who possesses them. If you have more than one track that changes a\nKey Ability Modifer, choose which change to apply frst. For example, the Rage track sets your\nKey O\ufb00ensive Modifer to Strength, while the Demo Man track sets it to Intelligence, so a character with both could choose between Strength or Intelligence for their Key O\ufb00ensive Modifer.\n\n\nThis choice is permanent, although if you gain or lose a track of this type with the Guild Initiation feat, relevant Key Modifers are reset according to what tracks you have afer the change.\n\n\nTypes of Abilities\n\n\nIn addition to things that all classes share (such as the ability to make attacks and move around), your character\u2019s choice of tracks determines the kind of special abilities they get. Different abilities are divided into one of four categories with general rules that govern them. The type of ability is indicated by \ncallout text\n.\n\n\nExtraordinary Abilities \nEX\n\n\nExtraordinary Abilities \nEX\n are abilities acquired through mundane training and e\ufb00ort. Extraordinary abilities cannot be dispelled and, unless otherwise stated, do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Some extraordinary abilities are \u201cpassive,\u201d or always on, and do not require activation. Extraordinary abilities that require activation commonly require a swift, immediate or standard action to activate.\n\n\nRules for activating, using, and recovering an extraordinary ability are contained within the\ntext of each specifc ability, and can vary from ability to ability. \n\n\nExtraordinary abilities are not limited to feats that normal humans can perform. As a humanoid creature (or any other) gains high levels, extraordinary abilities enable actions that are fantastic and epic in nature. However, these actions take the form of superhuman speed, strength, resistance, insight, or persuasion \u2013 overtly supernatural abilities such as calling fre from heaven are, by defnition, not extraordinary abilities.\n\n\nAll skill uses and most feats are extraordinary abilities.\n\n\nSpells\n\n\nSpells are instances of magic subject to defned rules for casting and recovery, available via specific tracks entirely dedicated to spellcasting.\nSpells are subject to [Dispelling] e\ufb00ects. Casting a spell generally provokes an attack of opportunity (however, casting a spell as a swif or immediate action does not). The full rules for spells can be found in Section XII.\n\n\nSpells are not marked with a \ncallout text\n, since they never appear as circles of a track. Instead, characters gain access to spells through a dedicated Spellcasting track.\n\n\nSpell Like Abilities \nSLA\n\n\nSpell-like Abilities \nSLA\n create e\ufb00ects similar to those generated by spells, but are not subject to the same general rules for casting and recovery. Spell-like abilities are generally activated as a standard action, but some are activated as a swif or immediate action. Activating a spell-like ability generally provokes an attack of opportunity, unless it is activated as a swif or immediate action or the text of the ability states that it does not provoke an attack of opportunity. They can be accessed in tracks not dedicated to spellcasting. Spell-like abilities are subject to [Dispelling] e\ufb00ects.\n\n\nRules for activating, using, and recovering a spell-like ability vary from ability to ability.\n\n\nSupernatural Abilities \nSU\n\n\nSupernatural Abilities \nSU\n generate magical e\ufb00ects, including e\ufb00ects similar to those of spells and spelllike abilities as well as unique e\ufb00ects. Some supernatural abilities are \u201cpassive,\u201d or always on, and do not require activation. Supernatural abilities that require activation are usually activated as a standard action, but are sometimes activated as a swift or immediate action.

This choice is permanent, although you can multiclass out of this track as normal.\n\n\nRage\n\n\nYour Key Offensive Modifier changes to Strength, unless your Key Defensive Modifier already is Strength. All bonuses from this track are fury bonuses, which stack with other fury bonuses from this track. At the beginning of your turn, you may choose not to benefit from fury bonuses to attack rolls, damage, and save DCs until the beginning of your next turn. Attacks and abilities that benefit from a fury bonus to attack rolls, damage, or save DCs cannot also deal damage with the \n[Precision]\n descriptor.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Rage \nEX\n\n\nYou channel the barbarian rage, a state where you gain heightened morale and physical prowess. As a swift action, if you are not \n[Fatigued]\n, \n[Exhausted]\n, or in a rage, you can enter a rage, which lasts for a maximum number of \n[Rounds]\n equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (if positive).\n\n\nWhile in a rage, you gain a +1 bonus per circle you possess from this track to attack rolls and damage you deal with attacks, and a +1 bonus to combat maneuver DCs and Fortitude and Will saves. When you enter a rage, you also gain 2 temporary HP per level. These temporary HP are lost when your rage ends. You can always prematurely end your rage as a free action.\n\n\nWhen your rage ends (either before the beginning of your turn due to its duration running out, or on your turn due to your ending it prematurely), you become \n[Fatigued]\n for as many \n[Rounds]\n as you spent raging (minimum 1), and you cannot begin a rage on either the turn it ends or on your following turn.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Powerful Rage \nEX\n\n\nYour rage gives you unusual physical ability equal to a creature much larger than yourself. You gain a +2 item bonus to Strength. While in a rage, your size becomes \n[Large]\n (if you are not already \n[Large]\n or \n[Huge]\n), you gain the normal +5 ft bonus to your movement speed, +2 bonus to saves against combat maneuvers, and 5 ft bonus to your \n[Melee]\n range associated with the \n[Large]\n size). While in a rage, you do not suffer any of the normal penalties of being \n[Large]\n, even if you\u2019re normally \n[Large]\n.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Intimidating Rage \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, when you enter a rage, you can attempt to intimidate a single opponent within 30 ft as a free action (as per the in-combat use of the Intimidate skill). If your intimidate attempt succeeds, that opponent becomes \n[Shaken]\n until the end of the \n[Encounter]\n. In addition, your bonus to combat maneuver DCs while raging increases to +2.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Greater Rage \nEX\n\n\nYour rage increases in potency. You gain 4 temporary HP per level when you rage instead of 2, and your bonuses to Fortitude and Will saves from Rage increase to +2. Additionally, select one of the following abilities (this choice is permanent):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHurling Charge:\n While raging, after making a melee attack as part of the Charge combat maneuver, you can use a ranged weapon in your possession to make a single ranged attack. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You can treat any square you moved into as part of the Charge combat maneuver as a square you occupy for purposes of the range, line of effect and line of sight of this attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMomentum Charge:\n While raging, if you use the Charge combat maneuver and your melee attack hits, you may immediately attempt the Bull Rush combat maneuver against the opponent hit. If your Bull Rush attempt succeeds, you may deal damage equal to your Key Offensive Modifier to that opponent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Stubborn Rage \nEX\n\n\nWhile in a rage, you possess \n[Immunity]\n to effects with the \n[Mind-affecting]\n descriptor. In addition, your bonus to combat maneuver DCs while raging increases to +3.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Mighty Rage \nEX\n\n\nThe power of your rage increases again. You gain 6 temporary HP per level when you rage instead of 4, and the bonus to Fortitude and Will saves increases to +4.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Heart of Fury \nEX\n\n\nYou are always considered \u201craging.\u201d You can activate the Intimidating Rage ability once per \n[Encounter]\n as a swift action. At the beginning of an \n[Encounter]\n, you gain temporary HP (as per Mighty Rage), and no less than 2 \n[Rounds]\n after gaining temporary HP from this ability, you may gain a new set of temporary HP as a swift action.\n\n\nDervish\n\n\nYour Key Offensive Modifier changes to Dexterity, unless your Key Defensive Modifier already is Dexterity. All bonuses from this track are fury bonuses, which stack with other fury bonuses from this track. At the beginning of your turn, you may choose not to benefit from fury bonuses to attack rolls, damage, and save DCs until the beginning of your next turn. Attacks and abilities that benefit from a fury bonus to attack rolls, damage, or save DCs cannot also deal damage with the \n[Precision]\n descriptor.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 War Dance \nEX\n\n\nYou can whip yourself into a war dance, a state in which you gain heightened morale and maneuverability. As a swift action, if you are not \n[Fatigued ]\n, \n[Exhausted]\n, or in a war dance, you can enter a war dance, which lasts for a maximum number of \n[Rounds]\n equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (if positive). While in this war dance you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, damage you deal with attacks, and Acrobatics checks per circle you possess from this track, a +1 bonus to Reflex and Will saves, and a +2 bonus to saves against combat maneuvers. You can always prematurely end your war dance as a free action. When your war dance ends (either before the beginning of your turn due to its duration running out, or on your your turn due to your ending it prematurely) you cannot begin a war dance on either the turn it ends or on your following turn. In addition, you are \n[Fatigued]\n for as many \n[Rounds]\n as you spent war dancing (minimum 1).\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Frenzied Strikes \nEX\n\n\nYour frantic movements become more focused and lethal. While in a war dance, you gain a \n[Bonus attack]\n whenever you take an attack action and you gain a 5 ft bonus to your movement speed, which increases to 10 ft at 4th circle and 15 ft at 6th circle.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Razor Wind \nEX\n\n\nYour whirling attacks amaze friend and foe alike, leaving vicious wounds at blinding speed. You gain a +2 bonus to Acrobatics checks. The first hit with an attack you make against each opponent each \n[Round]\n inflicts the \n[Burning]\n and \n[Bleeding]\n conditions on that opponent.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Greater War Dance \nEX\n\n\nYour war dance increases in potency, and you become adept at avoiding the sharp pointy bits of metal other people want to stick in you. Your bonuses to Reflex and Will saves while in a war dance increase to +2. While in a war dance, you gain 20% \n[Miss chance]\n. Additionally, select one of the following abilities (this choice is permanent):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloaked Dance: While in a war dance, you can use the Surprising an Opponent function of the Acrobatics skill as part of a move action without halving your movement speed.\nAdditionally, whenever you deal damage to a \n[Flat-footed]\n opponent, you deal additional damage equal to your KOM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTendon Sever: While in a war dance, any time you hit a \n[Flat-footed]\n opponent with an attack, you inflict the \n[Entangled]\n condition on that opponent for one \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Unstoppable War Dance \nEX\n\n\nWhile in a war dance, you gain \n[Immunity]\n to \n[Binding]\n effects, and moving out of a square of difficult terrain does not cost you extra movement.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Whirling War Dance \nEX\n\n\nYour war dance has reached the point where you are little more than a terrifying tempest of blades. Your bonuses to Reflex and Will saves while in a war dance increase to +4. Your ability to avoid damage increases as well, granting a 30% \n[Miss chance]\n while you are in a war dance.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Dance of Endless Blades \nEX\n\n\nYour war dance is a primal thing of terrible wrath and frightening beauty. Any time you hit a \n[Bleeding]\n opponent with an attack, they are \n[Battered]\n for the \n[Encounter]\n.\n\n\nAdditionally, while in a war dance, as a move action and a standard action, you move up to twice your movement speed without provoking attacks of opportunity. You may take an attack action during this movement, and may divide all of the attacks you are entitled to among any targets who were within \n[Melee]\n range at any point during your movement.\nFinally, you may enter your war dance as a free action.\n\n\nGuardian\n\n\nYour Key Offensive Modifier changes to Constitution, unless your Key Defensive Modifier is already Constitution. All bonuses from this track are fury bonuses, which stack with other fury bonuses from this track. At the beginning of your turn, you may choose not to benefit from fury bonuses to attack rolls, damage and save DCs until the beginning of your next turn. Attacks and abilities that benefit from a fury bonus to attack rolls, damage or save DCs cannot also deal \n[Precision]\n damage.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Defensive Stance \nEX\n\n\nYou can buckle down and enter a defensive stance, a state in which you gain increased endurance and resistance to enemy attacks. As a swift action, you can enter a defensive stance, gaining a +1 bonus to Vigor checks per circle you possess from this track (to a maximum of +7 with 7 circles). You also gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude and Will saves, and a +2 bonus on all saves against Combat Maneuvers. You can maintain this stance for a maximum number of \n[Rounds]\n equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (if positive) at any one time, and you can always prematurely exit the stance as a free action.\n\n\nWhen you exit the defensive stance, you are \n[Fatigued]\n for as many \n[Rounds]\n as you spent in it (minimum 1). You can begin the defensive stance whenever you wish, as long as you are not \n[Fatigued]\n or \n[Exhausted]\n. You are either in the defensive stance or not, so you cannot begin a new stance while already in one.\n\n\nNot This Time: Whenever you are in a defensive stance, you may reduce the damage taken from a single attack per \n[Round]\n by 5 per circle you possess from this track (to a maximum of 35 with 7 circles). This does not require an action. This ability cannot further reduce damage already reduced by this ability.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Hold Ground \nEX\n\n\nWhile in a defensive stance, enemies treat all squares within your \n[Melee]\n range as difficult terrain. In addition, all enemies within your \n[Melee]\n range take damage equal to your KOM at the end of your turn as long as you are in a defensive stance.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 You Shall Not Pass \nEX\n\n\nAs a move action, you may make an Intimidate check against an opponent. If this check succeeds, that foe may not take any offensive action for 1 \n[Round]\n unless the action includes you as a target.  This is a \n[Mind-affecting]\n \n[Fear]\n effect.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Greater Defensive Stance \nEX\n\n\nYour defensive stance increases in potency. Your bonus to Fortitude and Will saves increases to +2, and you may activate Not This Time twice per \n[Round]\n. Additionally, select one of the following abilities (this choice is permanent):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways Ready\n: Once per \n[Round]\n, as a non-action, you may make one additional attack of opportunity per round. However, you may never target the same opponent with an attack of opportunity more than once for the same action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving Wall\n: The effects of Hold Ground now extend to \n[Close]\n range. \n[Flying]\n, \n[Swimming]\n, and \n[Burrowing]\n opponents in these squares treat this difficult terrain as if they did not have those conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Rooted \nEX\n\n\nWhile in a defensive stance, you gain \n[Immunity]\n to \n[Prone]\n and any effect that would move you from your current square against your will (this includes Bull Rush and Drag combat maneuvers). Your bonus to saves against combat maneuvers in your defensive stance increases to +4. \n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Fortress Stance \nEX\n\n\nThe power of your defensive stance increases again. Your bonus to Fortitude and Will saves increases to +4, and you gain \n[Resistance]\n to physical damage while in your defensive stance. \n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Loyal Shield \nEX\n\n\nYou are considered to always be in your defensive stance. You may activate Not This Time three times per \n[Round]\n. Enemies within range of Hold Ground now take damage equal to twice your KOM at the end of your turn. You may now activate You Shall Not Pass as a swift action. If you chose Always Ready, you gain an +2 untyped (not Fury) bonus to attack and damage rolls with attacks of opportunity.\n\n\nPath of Destruction\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Cleave \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, as a swift action, when you hit an opponent with a melee attack and deal damage to that opponent with that attack, you may compare your attack roll from that attack to the AC of another target opponent within \n[Melee]\n range. If the attack roll equals or exceeds that opponent\u2019s AC, you deal damage to that opponent equal to the damage dealt by the attack. This ability is not an attack.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Whirlwind \nEX\n\n\nIf you would make one or more melee attacks during your standard action, you may add the \n[Volley]\n descriptor to a single one of those attacks; this attack with the \n[Volley]\n descriptor is applied against every opponent in \n[Melee]\n range.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Disrupting Presence \nEX\n\n\nYou are a living force of entropy, and creatures who attempt mental focus close to you suffer the consequences. For each opponent, the first time in a \n[Round]\n that opponent activates a spell, spell-like, or supernatural ability within your \n[Melee]\n range, that opponent takes damage equal to your character level.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Terrifying Presence \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, at the beginning of your turn, opponents within your \n[Melee]\n range become \n[Shaken]\n. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1\u20442 your level + your Charisma modifier) negates the effect. This application of the \n[Shaken]\n condition doesn\u2019t stack with itself, but stacks normally with other \n[Fear]\n effects. This is a \n[Mind-affecting]\n \n[Fear]\n effect.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Path of Blades \nEX\n\n\nWhen you use the Charge maneuver, you can make a single additional attack with the \n[Volley]\n descriptor as you make the Charge; this attack with the \n[Volley]\n descriptor is applied to all opponents within \n[Melee]\n range of squares you move into as part of the Charge.\nThis attack deals damage equal to three times your KOM.\n\n\n6th Circle\u2013Greater Cleave \nEX\n\n\nActivating Cleave no longer requires a swift action, and it can be used any number of times per \n[Round]\n (though you may only activate Cleave once per melee attack you make that hits an opponent and deals damage to that opponent). You may only activate Cleave once per attack you make.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Deadly Presence \nEX\n\n\nWhen an opponent begins their turn within your \n[Melee]\n range, it takes damage equal to your level + your Key Offensive Modifier and is \n[Battered]\n for one \n[Round]\n. This ability can be turned on or off as a swift action.\n\n\nPath of the Ancestors\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Lineage \nEX\n\n\nAny effect that would heal you but does not originate from you heals 1 extra point of damage for every level you possess. In addition, choose one of the following options. This choice is permanent:\n\n Guidance: You gain a bonus equal to half your level (minimum 1) on initiative rolls.\n\n Leading the Charge: When using the Charge combat maneuver, you ignore the normal -2 penalty to Armor Class.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Hard to Break \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, if you make a successful Fortitude or Will save against an effect that would normally have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as a spell with a save of \u201cFortitude half \u201d), you instead ignore the effect entirely.\nAdditionally, once per \n[Encounter]\n when you succeed on a Fortitude or Will save, you gain a +5 bonus to your next Vigor check.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Readiness \nEX\n\n\nYou gain a +2 bonus to Vigor checks, and becoming \n[Flat-footed]\n does not prevent you from making attacks of opportunity or taking immediate actions. Once per \n[Round]\n, you may make a Vigor check at any time during the \n[Round]\n. This does not require an action.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Resilience \nEX\n\n\nYou gain \n[Fast healing]\n equal to your character level.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Ancestral Blessing \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, as an immediate action, you can reroll a failed save.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Greater Readiness \nEX\n\n\nYou are always able to act in a surprise \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Strength Unbroken \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, as a swift action, you can begin an unstoppable assault. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain \n[Immunity]\n to damage, \n[Binding]\n effects, and the \n[Dazed]\n and \n[Stunned]\n conditions.",

Players who desire a more traditional, archetypal fighter may be interested in switching out the Forger track for Acrobatic Adept, Discipline of the Crane, or Path of the Ancestors.\n\n\nAttack and Save Progression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nBAB\n\n\nGood Saves\n\n\nPoor Saves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n7\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n8\n\n\n7\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n8\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n8\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n11\n\n\n9\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n12\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n13\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n14\n\n\n11\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n15\n\n\n12\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n16\n\n\n12\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n17\n\n\n13\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n18\n\n\n14\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n19\n\n\n14\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n20\n\n\n15\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n21\n\n\n16\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n22\n\n\n16\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n23\n\n\n17\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n24\n\n\n18\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n25\n\n\n18\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n26\n\n\n19\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n27\n\n\n20\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n28\n\n\n21\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n29\n\n\n21\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n30\n\n\n22\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaves\n\n\nFighters may choose Reflex or Will as their good save. Fortitude is always a good save for Fighters.\n\n\nMartial Prowess\n\n\nYou gain a +1 to Attack Rolls and AC.\n\n\nFighter Tracks\n\n\nAll Fighters gain the Soldier and Forger tracks, and may then choose a Martial Style.\n\n\nSoldier\n\n\nSome warriors depend on brute strength, others on technical skill. You are clearly the latter, so refined that you never take a single misstep. For every success you have, you gain momentum, which just makes you more potent. Truly, you are a martial juggernaut, nigh impossible to best in combat.\n\n\nThis track's abilities depend on \n[Concentration points]\n. A \n[Concentration point]\n is a mechanic unique to the Soldier track, and can be used only to activate Soldier abilities. \n[Concentration points]\n expire at the end of the \n[Encounter]\n, and you can have and expend a maximum number of \n[Concentration points]\n equal to twice your level in any given \n[Round]\n. Spending \n[Concentration points]\n is a non-action that can be done at any point during a \n[Round]\n (not just on your turn), but any ability requiring the spending of \n[Concentration points]\n can only be used once per \n[Round]\n unless otherwise noted (see below). It is not possible to reduce your \n[Concentration point]\n total below zero.\n\n\nYou start each \n[Encounter]\n with a number of \n[Concentration points]\n equal to the number of circles you have in this track.\n\n\n*\n[Amplifying]\n`: abilities with an asterisk can be used twice at the same time by spending twice the necessary\n[Concentration points]\n, doubling their effects. This allows a Soldier to bypass the once per\n[Round]` limit on abilities.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Focused Soldier \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, when you hit an opponent with an attack, or an attack misses you, you gain one \n[Concentration point]\n. Additionally, you gain all of the following abilities:\n\n\nDodge \n*\n\n\nYou can spend two \n[Concentration points]\n to gain a bonus to saves, and a deflection bonus to AC, equal to half the number of circles you have in this track for one \n[Round]\n, minimum 1.\n\n\nRecharge\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, you can spend a swift action to gain a number of \n[Concentration points]\n equal to your highest circle in this track.\n\n\nStrike\n\n\nWhen you make an attack, you can spend two \n[Concentration points]\n to gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll. If that attack hits, it deals additional damage equal to half your level.\n\n\nWithstand\n\n\nYou can spend two \n[Concentration points]\n to gain \n[Lesser resistance]\n against the damage dealt by one incoming attack, after you know the result of that attack.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Skilled Soldier \nEX\n\n\nYou gain two \n[Concentration points]\n whenever the Focused Soldier ability activates, instead of one. Additionally, you gain all of the following abilities:\n\n\nFeint\n\n\nBy spending three \n[Concentration points]\n, you can force one opponent you have line of sight to to make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or be affected as if you had successfully used the in-combat use of the Bluff skill against them.\n\n\nTerrify\n\n\nBy spending three \n[Concentration points]\n, you can force one opponent you have line of sight to to make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or be affected as if you had successfully used the in-combat use of the Intimidate skill against them.\n\n\nVeteran\u2019s Analysis\n\n\nBy spending three \n[Concentration points]\n, you can force one opponent you have line of sight to to make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or be affected as if you had successfully used the in-combat use of the Perception skill against them.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Powerful Soldier \nEX\n\n\nYou gain three \n[Concentration points]\n whenever the Focused Soldier ability activates, instead of two. Additionally, you gain all of the following abilities:\n\n\nAdrenaline \n*\n\n\nBy spending four \n[Concentration points]\n you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level and a 10 ft bonus to your movement speed for one \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nDisable \n*\n\n\nWhen you make an attack, you can spend four \n[Concentration points]\n. If that attack hits, it reduces your opponent\u2019s move speed by half for one \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nReorient\n\n\nWhen you use Recharge, you now gain a number of \n[Concentration points]\n equal to twice your highest circle in this track.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Brilliant Soldier \nEX\n\n\nYou gain four \n[Concentration points]\n whenever the Focused Soldier ability activates, instead of three. Once per \n[Encounter]\n per four levels, you may use one of the following abilities:\n\n\nBash\n\n\nWhen you make an attack, you can spend five \n[Concentration points]\n to cause that attack, if it hits to force the opponent to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) or be knocked \n[Prone]\n.\n\n\nDuck\n\n\nWhen your Armor Class is targeted by an attack, you can spend five \n[Concentration points]\n to gain a +5 bonus to AC against that one attack, and if your opponent misses you, and if they are in a square you threaten, you can make an attack of opportunity against them.\n\n\nLeap Attack \n*\n\n\nImmediately before using a standard action, you can spend five \n[Concentration points]\n to move up to your movement speed.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Mighty Soldier \nEX\n\n\nYou gain five \n[Concentration points]\n whenever the Focused Soldier ability activates, instead of four. Once per \n[Encounter]\n per four levels, you may use one of the following abilities:\n\n\nKeep Going\n\n\nBy expending six \n[Concentration points]\n, you gain \n[Immunity]\n to \n[Unconscious]\n and \n[Dying]\n for one \n[Round]\n, though you still die when your hit point total reaches your negative Constitution score.\n\n\nLock Blades\n\n\nBy expending six \n[Concentration]\n points when an opponent leaves your \n[Melee]\n range, that opponent must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) or become \n[Grappled]\n by you as if hit by the Grapple combat maneuver.\n\n\nRecuperate\n\n\nWhen you use Recharge, you now gain a number of \n[Concentration points]\n equal to three times your highest circle in this track.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Genius Soldier \nEX\n\n\nYou gain six \n[Concentration points]\n whenever the Focused Soldier ability activates, instead of five. Once per \n[Encounter]\n per five levels, you may use one of the following abilities:\n\n\nRedirect\n\n\nWhen an opponent targets you with a single-target offensive action, you can expend seven \n[Concentration points]\n, before you learn the result of the offensive action, to change its target to another opponent within the offensive action\u2019s range. The opponent whose offensive action is being redirected is entitled to a Reflex save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) to negate this effect.\n\n\nSend Flying\n\n\nBy spending seven \n[Concentration points]\n at the beginning of your turn, you can add devastating force to your blows. For one \n[Round]\n, every time you hit an opponent with an attack, that opponent is \n[Blown away]\n. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates the \n[Blown away]\n effect.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Deadly Soldier \nEX\n\n\nYou gain seven \n[Concentration points]\n whenever the Focused Soldier ability activates, instead of six. Once per \n[Encounter]\n per five levels, by expending eight \n[Concentration points]\n, you may use one of the following abilities:\n\n\nRejuvenate\n\n\nWhen you use Recharge, you now gain a number of \n[Concentration points]\n equal to four times your highest circle in this track.\n\n\nUntouchable\n\n\nFor one \n[Round]\n, as a free action, you gain \n[Greater resistance]\n to physical damage. However, in the \n[Round]\n after that, you gain \n[Vulnerability]\n to physical damage. You may not use Untouchable for two \n[Rounds]\n in a row.\n\n\nCrushing Blow\n\n\nWhen you make an attack, you can spend eight \n[Concentration points]\n. If that attack hits, it deals additional damage equal to three times your character level.\n\n\nForger\n\n\nThere are Blacksmiths, who craft weapons and armor, and then there are Forgers, who craft legends. You are, of course, the latter. No one knows their way around a smithy better or is more at home with a hammer and anvil in their hands. However, your talents are not confined to the workshop \u2013 you have also developed a unique resilience that allows you to withstand furious onslaughts in the heat of battle.\n\n\n1st Circle - Child of Iron\n\n\nChoose two items (each must be a weapon, armor, or a shield) in your possession. A weapon increases its item bonus to attack rolls by 1, armor increases its item bonus to AC by 1, and a selected shield increases its deflection bonus to AC by 1. The item to which these bonuses apply may be changed at the beginning of each \n[Scene]\n. \n\n\nIf an item affected by this track is not used by you (or, at 4th circle, its recipient), it loses all benefits of this track.\n\n\nAdditionally, between \n[Scenes]\n, you may change or remove the mundane weapon properties of any weapon in your possession (this includes any weapons loaned to you by allies, or stolen from enemies \u2013 in other words, the weapon does not have to be yours in order for you to alter its properties).\n\n\n2nd Circle - Smith\u2019s Sturdiness\n\n\nYou gain \n[Lesser resistance]\n to physical damage. Additionally, you gain the constant benefit of the Endure Elements spell, but only as it regards Heat.\n\n\n3rd Circle  - Sunder\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, and a total number of times per \n[Encounter]\n equal to half the number of circles you have in this track, after a melee attack has been made against you, you can immediately (regardless of whether it hit or missed) force your opponent to make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or be disarmed as if you had used the Disarm combat maneuver.\n\n\n4th Circle - Metalworker\u2019s Mastery\n\n\nIn addition to the two chosen items that you carry, Child of Iron can affect one item possessed by an ally (chosen at the beginning of each \n[Scene]\n). Between \n[Scenes]\n, you may change or remove the magical item properties of any magic item in your possession (this includes any items loaned to you by allies, or stolen from enemies \u2013 in other words, the item does not have to be occupying one of your item slots in order for you to alter its properties). This only affects weapons created using the Item Point Buy rules.\n\n\n5th Circle - Greater Sunder\n\n\nYou may use your Sunder ability at will (though still only once per \n[Round]\n), and weapons affected by Sunder lose two weapon properties of the wielder's choice until the end of the \n[Encounter]\n.\n\n\n6th Circle - Forger\u2019s Fortitude\n\n\nYou gain \n[Fast healing]\n equal to your character level and your \n[Lesser resistance]\n to physical damage increases to \n[Resistance]\n.\n\n\n7th Circle - Lord of Iron\n\n\nThe items you select to be affected by your Child of Iron ability now have their item bonuses increased by two instead of one, and every weapon, armor, or shield you select for your Child of Iron ability gains one additional point that can be spent on magical enchantment. This does not change the slot the item takes up (so a Relic weapon that you use Child of Iron on has four points of enchantments, but still takes up a Relic slot).\n\n\nAdditionally, anyone wielding a weapon benefiting from your Child of Iron ability gains \n[Immunity]\n to being disarmed by the Disarm maneuver, and weapons affected by Child of Iron can never have their properties removed (although they can still be changed, such as using Metalworker\u2019s Mastery or the Variable magic weapon property).\n\n\nCrashing Wave\n\n\nYou always loved the ocean, and the part that fascinates you most is the rolling of the tides. They sweep up and down the beach, carrying shells and debris, and can be both beautiful and frighteningly destructive. You seek to emulate these crashing waves in the midst of combat.\n\n\nAll bonuses from this track are fury bonuses, which stack with other fury bonuses from this track. At the beginning of your turn, you may choose not to benefit from fury bonuses to attack rolls, damage and save DCs until the beginning of your next turn. Attacks and abilities that benefit from a fury bonus to attack rolls, damage or save DCs cannot also deal \n[Precision]\n damage.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Tide EX\n\n\nYou are adept at emulating the motions of a restless sea, making slow, powerful swings that devastate your foes. As a standard action, you may make a single melee attack. This attack gains a bonus on the attack roll equal to the number of circles you have in this track and deals bonus damage equal to your level.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Eroding Waters EX\n\n\nYou wear down your enemies like water on rock. If you hit the same opponent with a Tide attack twice in the same \n[Encounter]\n, they are \n[Fatigued]\n for the rest of the \n[Encounter]\n. If you hit the same opponent with Tide four times in the same \n[Encounter]\n, they lose \n[Fatigued]\n and instead become \n[Exhausted]\n for the rest of the \n[Encounter]\n.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Roiling Sea EX\n\n\nYour blows wax and wane like flowing waves. When you make a Tide attack, you can opt to ignore two points of \n[Damage reduction]\n and \n[Resistance]\n per circle you have in this track. In the following \n[Round]\n, you gain two points of \n[Damage reduction]\n per circle you have in this track. You cannot use this ability in two consecutive \n[Rounds]\n.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Deadly Current EX\n\n\nYou toss your enemies to and fro like a riptide. Your Tide attacks now deal bonus damage equal to twice your level instead of your level, and are treated as a hit with one of the following combat maneuvers, forcing your opponent to make a save against the effect of the chosen combat maneuver as normal: Bull Rush, Disarm, Grapple, or Trip (chosen at the time the Tide attack is made).\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Ocean\u2019s Roar EX\n\n\nBehind every swipe of your sword is the rushing sound of water and the might of a tidal wave. Whenever you use Roiling Sea, you can ignore four points of \n[Damage reduction]\n and resistance instead of two, your target becomes \n[Deafened]\n until the end of the \n[Encounter]\n, and if your attack hits, you can make a \n[Bonus attack]\n, and you gain three points of \n[Damage reduction]\n per circle you have in this track in the following \n[Round]\n instead of two.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Whirlpool EX\n\n\nYou manipulate the battlefield, sending adversaries flying in all directions. You are an eye of calm at the center of a vortex of destruction. When you hit an opponent with a Tide attack, that opponent takes a penalty to attack rolls and AC equal to half your highest circle of the Crashing Wave track for the remainder of the \n[Encounter]\n. This penalty does not stack with itself. Additionally, once per \n[Encounter]\n per five levels, as a free action once per \n[Round]\n, all opponents in \n[Close]\n range of you must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or be \n[Blown away]\n in a direction of your choice.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Tsunami EX\n\n\nYou are the ultimate embodiment of the destruction an ocean can wreak. Your Tide attacks deal bonus damage equal to three times your level instead of twice your level, and opponents hit by your Tide attacks are \n[Energy drained]\n. Additionally, your Tide attacks are treated as hits with two of the combat maneuvers made available by Deadly Current instead of one.\n\n\nDarting Kingfisher\n\n\nMost people see combat as a fight to the death with a mortal enemy. You don\u2019t look at it that way. To you, a battle is as simple as a kingfisher hunting fish, predator and prey\u2026and anyone who has seen you in action knows exactly which one is you. You don\u2019t believe in honorable duels, and you don\u2019t salute your opponent before attacking them. You are efficient, ruthless, and deadly.\n\n\nAll bonuses from this track are fury bonuses, which do not stack with other tracks\u2019 fury bonuses. A creature benefiting from a fury bonus may not benefit from other sources of \n[Precision]\n damage.\n\n\nSome abilities in this track are denoted as \n[Kingfisher]\n abilities. \n[Kingfisher]\n abilities may not be used together on the same attack (although they can be used together over the course of one attack action if applied to different attacks).\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Ambush EX\n\n\nYou attack silently and without warning. You don\u2019t play by the rules in combat, and you\u2019re proud of it. You gain a +2 bonus to Acrobatics checks and the in-combat use of the Bluff skill, and you deal 1d4 bonus damage per circle you have in this track on successful attacks against \n[Flat-footed]\n opponents.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Vicious Dive EX\n\n\nLike a kingfisher swooping down from the branches, you appear out of nowhere and pierce your victim\u2019s flesh. Once per \n[Round]\n, a \n[Flat-footed]\n opponent hit by one of your attacks becomes \n[Bleeding]\n.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Kingfisher\u2019s Strike EX\n\n\nYou knock the wind out of your prey or sweep them off their feet. Once per \n[Round]\n, a \n[Flat-footed]\n opponent hit by one of your attacks is \n[Slowed]\n for one \n[Round]\n or knocked \n[Prone]\n. This is a \n[Kingfisher]\n ability. Additionally, your Vicious Dive ability applies to all successful attacks you make against \n[Flat-footed]\n opponents, not just one per \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Kingfisher\u2019s Spear EX\n\n\nWith a thrust to the hamstring or a similar deft maneuver, you severely hamper your foe\u2019s mobility. Once per \n[Round]\n, a \n[Flat-footed]\n opponent hit by one of your attacks becomes \n[Entangled]\n for two \n[Rounds]\n. This is a \n[Kingfisher]\n ability. Whenever you use a \n[Kingfisher]\n ability, you inflict the \n[Battered]\n condition on your opponent. \n\n\nAdditionally, the bonus damage on successful attacks against \n[Flat-footed]\n opponents you gained from your Ambush ability now increases to 2d4 per circle you have in this track.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Kingfisher\u2019s Lash EX\n\n\nYou swipe for your target\u2019s eyes, leaving them unable to defend themselves while they struggle to regain their sight. Once per \n[Round]\n, a \n[Flat-footed]\n opponent hit by one of your attacks becomes \n[Blinded]\n for two \n[Rounds]\n. This is a \n[Kingfisher]\n ability. Whenever you use a \n[Kingfisher]\n ability, you inflict the \n[Sickened]\n condition on your opponent. \n\n\nAdditionally, for every \n[Kingfisher]\n ability you have used on an opponent in this \n[Encounter]\n, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 bonus to damage on attacks, against that opponent.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Kingfisher\u2019s Stun EX\n\n\nYou stun your unfortunate opponent with a sudden blow. Once per \n[Round]\n, and a total of three times per \n[Encounter]\n, a \n[Flat-footed]\n opponent hit by one of your attacks must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or become \n[Dazed]\n. This is a \n[Kingfisher]\n ability.\n\n\nAdditionally, whenever you use a \n[Kingfisher]\n ability, you inflict the \n[Prone]\n condition on your opponent. \n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Death From Above EX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, after making a successful attack and activating a \n[Kingfisher]\n ability (the opponent does not need to fail its save, if there is one), you can deal an extra 6 damage per level you possess and make the target \n[Nauseated]\n. This is a \n[Death]\n effect.\n\n\nFlickering Candle\n\n\nYou are not a fire elemental, but it might be said that you resemble one. You almost seem to flicker as you move, and glowing sparks dance in your eyes. In combat, you wait for your opponent to make a mistake, hypnotizing them with your fluid and acrobatic movements until they expose themselves to your devastating strikes.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Swaying Fires \nEX\n\n\nYou strike with the swiftness of a fleeting flame. Once per \n[Round]\n, as a move action or part of a move action, directly before making an attack, you can declare which opponent you will be attacking and make an Acrobatics check (DC 10 + your opponent\u2019s level). You deal bonus \n[Precision]\n damage on your next attack equal to the amount by which your Acrobatics check exceeded the DC.\n\n\nTumbler \nEX\n\n\nAdditionally, you gain a +2 bonus to Acrobatics checks.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Flame Sting \nEX\n\n\nThose who thrust their hands into flames often find themselves burned. As a standard action, make a single attack. Whenever you are attacked until the beginning of your next turn, immediately after the attack is resolved, you can make an attack against the opponent that attacked you. This attack is called a Flame Sting attack. At 2nd circle you may only make one Flame Sting attack per \n[Round]\n. This expands to two Flame Sting attacks per \n[Round]\n at 4th circle, and three Flame Sting attacks per \n[Round]\n at 6th circle. You can never use a Flame Sting attack in the same \n[Round]\n that you use a Once More! attack, and vice versa.\n\n\nCan\u2019t Catch Me! \nEX\n\n\nAdditionally, once per \n[Round]\n, when an attack misses you, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your KOM for one \n[Round]\n. This increases to twice your KOM at fourth circle and three times your KOM at sixth circle.\n\n\n### 3rd Circle \u2013 Entrancing Flame \nEX\n\n\nThe beautiful and deadly movements of fire have been \n known to mesmerize onlookers. If you are within the range of an opponent\u2019s attack (whether it is melee or ranged), at your option, when they declare they are attacking, they must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KDM) or be forced to attack you instead of their intended target.\n          Lightning Draw: Additionally, you treat all weapons as if they possess the \n[Quick-draw]\n property.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Dancing Fires  \nEX\n\n\nYou sear your enemies like a burning torch. Whenever you \nuse Swaying Fires, the bonus \n[Precision]\n damage applies to all attacks you make against that opponent in that \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Shifting Embers \nEX\n\n\nYou spin and twist around your foes like a roaring inferno. After making a Flame Sting attack, you can immediately move 10 ft. Unless you are hit with an attack of opportunity for this movement, you gain a 20% \n[Miss chance]\n against the opponent you attacked for one \n[Round]\n. If that opponent is within \n[Melee]\n range, you can cause them to move 10 ft in the same direction, as well as to begin \n[Burning]\n. If that opponent is within \n[Close]\n range, you may make them \n[Flat-footed]\n against your attacks until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Raging Fires \nEX\n\n\nWith the deft skill of a trained martial artist, you can toss your opponents to and fro, felling them like logs beneath the heel of a devastating forest fire. You can use Swaying Fires as a free action, and once per \n[Round]\n, when an opponent is hit by an attack affected by Swaying Fires, they must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or become \n[Burning]\n, \n[Entangled]\n, and \n[Prone]\n.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Servant of the Secret Fire \nEX\n\n\nYou know the great techniques of the art of the Flickering Candle, taught only to the most loyal and skilled disciples. Whenever you decide to use Entrancing Flame, it works automatically (instead of requiring a save). Additionally, any Acrobatics check you make is treated as a natural 20.\n\n\nShining Sun\n\n\nWhen asked, \u201cWhat is your weapon of choice?\u201d you point at your fellow adventurers. While you are an able combatant in your own right, your main strength is in inspiring or advising your allies. Like the celestial body your style is named for, you light the way for your companions, illuminating the darkness that lies before them.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 All-Seeing Sun \nEX\n\n\nYour shining rays lead your friends towards new levels of greatness. You have learned that working as a team is of utmost importance in battle, so you ensure that your companions do so. If two or more allies you have line of sight to threaten the same opponent, they gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, and add half your level to damage on attacks against that opponent.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Glowing Surge \nEX\n\n\nThrough tactics, insight, or inspiring words, you can spur a companion forward. Once per \n[Round]\n, as a swift action, one ally you have line of sight to may move up to their movement speed in a direction of their choice.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Dazzling Surge \nEX\n\n\nUpon hearing your words, or seeing you standing proud like a shining beacon amidst the chaos of war, those around you are instilled with renewed vigor and determination. Once per \n[Encounter]\n per five levels, when you use Glowing Surge on an ally, that ally can make a single melee or ranged attack at the end of their movement. This is a \n[Bonus attack]\n.\n\n\n### 4th Circle \u2013 Beams of Inspiration \nEX\n\n\nA shrewd warning or a piece of advice gives your fellow warrior an extra trick up their sleeve. Once per \n[Round]\n, and a total number of times per \n[Encounter]\n equal to one for every five levels you have, you can grant an ally an extra swift or move action. The target ally can take no more than a total of three swift and immediate actions per \n[Round]\n using this ability. This ability is not an action and can be used at any point during a \n[Round]\n, even when it is not your turn.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Rays of Death \nEX\n\n\nIn addition to inspiring hope in the minds of your allies, you also strike fear in the hearts of your enemies. At the end of your turn, opponents in your \n[Close]\n range must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or become \n[Shaken]\n. You may only use this ability every other \n[Round]\n. This is a \n[Fear]\n \n[Mind-affecting]\n ability.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Blinding Surge \nEX\n\n\nYou incite your comrades onward towards legend. Once per \n[Encounter]\n when you use Glowing Surge and Dazzling Surge, you can affect two allies instead of one. Additionally, your allies add half your level to initiative checks.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 The Power of the Sun\u2026: \nEX\n\n\n\u2026is in the palm of your hand. Once per \n[Encounter]\n as a standard action, you can affect all allies you have line of sight to with your Glowing Surge and Dazzling Surge abilities. If an ally hits with an attack granted by this Dazzling Surge, the opponent they hit is \n[Blinded]\n. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates the \n[Blinded]\n condition. This counts as a single use of your Dazzling Surge per \n[Encounter]\n.\n\n\nUnrelenting Storm\n\n\nA storm is a visual and auditory symphony, filled with the roll of thunder and the flash of lightning. Many, overwhelmed by its strange beauty, fear the storm, but you have chosen to allow it to overwhelm you and become a part of you. You have learned to channel this energy through your hails of arrows and knives.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Iron Lightning \nEX\n\n\nYou can turn any weapon you hold into a raindrop in a hurricane of steel. Any melee weapon you wield (unless it is a natural attack with no other properties, such as an Unarmed Strike) gains the \n[Thrown]\n property, and two other weapon properties of your choice, for as long as you wield it, and any ranged weapon you wield (unless it is a natural attack with no other properties) gains three weapon properties of your choice for as long as you wield it. Once made, this choice is permanent. These properties cannot be removed or traded away from a weapon you wield in any way, including through the Variable enchantment. You cannot grant a weapon the \n[Arcane]\n property with this ability. Additionally, once per \n[Round]\n after you hit an opponent with an attack, that opponent must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) or become \n[Battered]\n for one \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Ride the Hurricane \nEX\n\n\nYou carry yourself high through the air, as if the very winds were at your command. Once per \n[Round]\n, when you hit with a ranged attack, you can choose to gain \n[Flying]\n and the Fly movement mode until the end of your next turn. If you use this ability and you are already \n[Flying]\n, you can instead choose to deal additional damage with your ranged attack equal to half your level.\n\n\n### 3rd Circle \u2013 Raging Tempest \nEX\n\n\nYou rend the battlefield with your ferocious onslaught. Once per \n[Encounter]\n per five levels you possess, you can make a single ranged attack, as a standard action, that targets all opponents within its range. Abilities and effects other than the attack\u2019s normal damage that take place as the result of a hit or critical hit only activate once as a result of this attack, and apply to no more than one opponent you hit, of your choice.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Like the Thunderbolt \nEX\n\n\nYour attacks are faster and more powerful than bolts of lightning, and your foes are lucky to even see them coming before they strike. On an attack action consisting only of ranged attacks, you can make one \n[Bonus attack]\n, and once per \n[Round]\n, an opponent hit with one of your ranged attacks must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) or become \n[Slowed]\n. Additionally, whenever you use Ride the Hurricane, you can increase the range of any ranged weapon you wield by one range category (to a maximum of \n[Extreme]\n range).\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Eye of the Storm \nEX\n\n\nAs a true disciple of the way of the storm, you never allow the chaos of battle to influence you. Ranged attacks you make do not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you gain a +3 bonus to ranged attack rolls.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Far-reaching Rains \nEX\n\n\nNo place is safe from your violent downpour. If you are wielding a ranged weapon, you threaten all squares within your \n[Close]\n range. You can make attacks of opportunity with ranged weapons. Once per \n[Round]\n, and once per \n[Encounter]\n per four levels in total, you can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who provokes one even if you have already expended all of your attacks of opportunity for the \n[Round]\n. Additionally, whenever you use Ride the Hurricane, you deal bonus damage equal to your level, instead of half your level.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Distant Tornado \nEX\n\n\nSitting atop your pinnacle of furious glory, no enemy can touch you, and any fool who tries will feel the wrathful bite of your thunder and lightning. Once per \n[Encounter]\n as an immediate action, when an opponent enters a square within your \n[Melee]\n range, you can immediately move up to your speed and make a ranged attack action.",

At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties.

If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 5 f, and you can choose to move into their previously occupied space. If you choose not to move into their space, you may instead push them 5 f in the same direction per circle of Discipline of the Serpent you possess.\n\n\nThese movements do not provoke attacks of opportunity. A successful Pushing Blow benefits from abilities that would enhance a successful Bull Rush.\n\n\nNeutralize\n\n\nAs a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Will save or take a penalty to damage equal to the number of circles you possess in Discipline of the Serpent for 1 \n[Round]\n. This penalty does not stack with itself.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Open and Close \nEX\n\n\nYou gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:\n\n\nClose Meridian\n\n\nAs a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or be \n[Sickened]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nOpen Gate\n\n\nAs a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Will save or all creatures gain a +2 bonus to skill checks against the target and saves against the target\u2019s abilities for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nIn addition, when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip, you may immediately make a \n[Bonus attack]\n.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Ceaseless Flow \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nIf you replace a \n[Bonus attack]\n using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your \n[Bonus attack]\n for that \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Stop the Breath \nEX\n\n\nYour combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip, it is \n[Flat-footed]\n until the beginning of its next turn.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Poison the Blood \nEX\n\n\nEach time you deal \n[Precision]\n damage to an opponent with Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip during an attack action, or an opponent fails a save against any of those combat maneuvers during an attack action you make, that opponent gains an \n[Imbalance]\n.\n\n\nThese \n[Imbalances]\n cause the opponent to gain various conditions, as below, and have no other effects on the opponent. \n[Imbalances]\n disappear at the end of each attack action, but conditions your opponents have gained from this ability do not disappear when \n[Imbalances]\n do.\n\n\n\n\nTwo \n[Imbalances]\n: The opponent is \n[Battered]\n for 2 \n[Rounds]\n.\n\n\nFour \n[Imbalances]\n: The opponent is \n[Blinded]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nSix \n[Imbalances]\n: The opponent is \n[Slowed]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nEight \n[Imbalances]\n: The opponent is \n[Nauseated]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nTen \n[Imbalances]\n: The opponent is \n[Stunned]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf multiple opponents would gain \n[Imbalances]\n from a single combat maneuver, you instead\nchoose one of those opponents to gain an \n[Imbalance]\n.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 On Power \nEX\n\n\nYou can now use Ceaseless Flow any number of times per \n[Round]\n, and Stop the Breath now affects any opponent you hit with Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip, regardless of whether they successfully save against it or not.\n\n\nDisciple of the Tiger\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 External Techniques \nEX\n\n\nChoose five weapon properties other than \n[Arcane]\n, \n[Barbed]\n, \n[Distant]\n, \n[Hold-out]\n or \n[Quick-draw]\n. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon\u2019s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.\n\n\nAdditionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties\nyour Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses. You may grant it 2 such properties at 1st circle, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, and 5 at 7th. The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.\n\n\nAttacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the \n[Precision]\n descriptor equal to your level.\n\n\n2nd Circle - Aerial Ace \nEX\n\n\nYour combat maneuvers, and opponents\u2019 attempts to escape or act in a \n[Grappled]\n or \n[Pinned]\n condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:\n\n\nUppercut\n\n\nSwinging in a upward motion, you knock a target into the air. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Reflex save or begin \n[Flying]\n. While the target does not possess the Fly movement mode, they are unable to move until the end of your turn. If the target does not possess the Fly movement mode at the end of your turn, they cease \n[Flying]\n. \n\n\nIf the target never possessed the Fly movement mode from when you used Uppercut on them until the end of your turn, they take 1d6 fall damage per circle of Discipline of the Tiger you possess. If they are over a \n[Swimming]\n area, this damage is halved.\n\n\nAxe Kick\n\n\nSwinging in a downward motion, you slam a target to the ground. As a standard action while \n[Flying]\n, you make a single melee attack against a \n[Flying]\n target that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Reflex save or cease \n[Flying]\n and take 1d6 fall damage per circle of Discipline of the Tiger you possess. If they are over a \n[Swimming]\n area, this damage is halved. If the target had previously failed their save against Uppercut during your turn, they suffer the damage from that Combat Maneuver when they take the damage from this Combat Maneuver.\n\n\nFor both of these Combat Maneuvers, you can not provoke an Attack of Opportunity from your target from after you hit them until the end of your turn if they failed their save against said Combat Maneuver.\n\n\n3rd Circle - Relentless Pursuit \nEX\n\n\nYou gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:\n\n\nFlying Strike\n\n\nYou approach your enemy at high speed, utilizing your momentum to deal a blow. As a standard action, you may move up to your speed in a straight line and make a single melee attack. Any obstruction in a straight-line path prevents you from using Flying Strike (although you could maneuver to a straight-line path, if one exists, with your move action). You are not required to move and may change movement modes at the end of your movement (or lack thereof). \n\n\nYou do not provoke an Attack of Opportunity from your target or anybody along your path, and you only provoke an Attack of Opportunity from enemies threatening your initial position if you have not hit and damaged them with a melee attack this round.\n\n\nForceful Blow\n\n\nYou deliver a powerful strike to an enemy's center of gravity, sending them careening away. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or be pushed in 1 direction a distance equal to your movement speed. This movement does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.\n\n\nIn addition, when an opponent fails a save against a combat maneuver you perform you may immediately make a \n[Bonus attack]\n. If you strike a target with a combat maneuver that does not prompt a save, you may force the target to make a Reflex save.  If the target fails this save, you may make a \n[Bonus Attack]\n.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Ceaseless Flow \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nIf you replace a \n[Bonus attack]\n using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your \n[Bonus attack]\n for that \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Stop the Breath \nEX\n\n\nYour combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Axe Kick, Disarm, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut, it is \n[Flat-footed]\n until the beginning of its next turn.\n\n\n6th Circle - Rocket Punch \nEX\n\n\nA living weapon, you literally launch yourself at your target. Once per \n[Encounter]\n when using Ceaseless Flow, you may replace your attack with both a Flying Strike and a Forceful Blow. For this ability, the movement range for Flying Strike is doubled, and the DC for Forceful Blow is increased by 1. On a critical hit with an attack affected by this ability, the DC for Forceful Blow is instead increased by 2, and an opponent failing their Fortitude save against Forceful Blow is \n[Blown Away]\n the distance they would have been pushed.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 On Power \nEX\n\n\nYou can now use Ceaseless Flow any number of times per \n[Round]\n, and Stop the Breath now affects any opponent you hit with Axe Kick, Disarm, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut, regardless of whether they successfully save against it or not.\n\n\nDisciple of the Monkey\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 External Techniques \nEX\n\n\nChoose five weapon properties other than \n[Arcane]\n, \n[Barbed]\n, \n[Distant]\n, \n[Hold-out]\n or \n[Quick-draw]\n. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon\u2019s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.\n\n\nAdditionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties\nyour Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses.

The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.\n\n\nAttacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the \n[Precision]\n descriptor equal to your level.\n\n\n2nd Cirle - Go to no Evil, Do no Evil\n\n\nYour combat maneuvers, and opponents\u2019 attempts to escape or act in a \n[Grappled]\n or \n[Pinned]\n condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:\n\n\nCrippling Jabs \nEX\n\n\nYou target your opponent's legs with rapid successive strikes, stunting their agility and movement range. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Reflex save or take a -1 penalty to their Reflex saves for 1 \n[Round]\n and suffer a -5 ft penalty to their movement speed (minimum: their base movement speed) until the end of the \n[Encounter]\n. Every 5ft lost counts as a separate status condition for the purposes of effects that remove status conditions.\n\n\nDisabling Jabs \nEX\n\n\nYou target your opponent's arms with rapid successive strikes, stunting their offensive capability and range. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty to their attack rolls for 1 \n[Round]\n and either  (you decide which) suffer a -5 ft penalty to their melee attack range (minimum: 5 ft) or lose the furthest range with any ranged attack (minimum: \n[Close]\n range). Every 5ft or range increment lost counts as a separate status condition for the purposes of effects that remove status conditions.\n\n\n3rd Circle - See no Evil, Be no Evil\n\n\nYou gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:\n\n\nImpairing Jabs \nEX\n\n\nYou target your opponent's head with rapid successive strikes, stunting their concentration and vision. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Will save or take a -1 penalty to their Will saves for 1 \n[Round]\n and lose 1 vision mode (or have the effects of the Arcane Sight, Blindsight, See Invisibility, or True Seeing spells upon them dispelled) of their choice (minimum: normal vision or \n[Blindsight]\n if possessing the Justice, Blind \n[Iconic]\n feat) until the end of the \n[Encounter]\n. Each vision mode lost counts as a separate status condition for the purposes of effects that remove status conditions.\n\n\nDebilitating Jabs \nEX\n\n\nYou target your opponent's core with rapid successive strikes, stunting their stamina and endurance. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty to their Fortitude saves for 1 \n[Round]\n and become \n[Battered]\n until the end of the \n[Encounter]\n.\n\n\nIn addition, when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip, you may immediately make a \n[Bonus attack]\n.\n\n\n4th Circle - Ceaseless Flow \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Crippling Jabs, Debilitating Jabs, Disabling Jabs, Disarm, Grapple, Impairing Jabs, Pin, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this \n[Round]\n. If you replace a \n[Bonus attack]\n using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your \n[Bonus attack]\n for that \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n5th Circle - Stop the Breath \nEX\n\n\nYour combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Crippling Jabs, Debilitating Jabs, Disabling Jabs, Disarm, Grapple, Impairing Jabs, Pin, or Trip, it is \n[Flat-footed]\n until the beginning of its next turn.\n\n\n6th Circle - No Evil\n\n\nChoose one of the following abilities (this choice is permanent):\n\n\nDefeat All Evil \nEX\n\n\nYour Combat Maneuvers become more devastating in ways unique to each:\n\n\n\n\nDouble Disarm:\n On a failed save, Disarm additionally causes the target to drop their shield (if any).\n\n\nStrangle:\n Choke additionally causes \n[Bleeding]\n and \n[Burning]\n.\n\n\nRoundhouse / Slide Tackle:\n On a failed save, Trip instead causes \n[Blown Away]\n.\n\n\nCrippling Flurry:\n On a failed save, Crippling Jabs additionally causes a -1 penalty to AC for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nDisabling Flurry:\n On a failed save, Disabling Jabs additionally causes a -3 penalty to damage for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nImpairing Flurry:\n On a failed save, Impairing Jabs additionally causes a -1 penalty to both Awareness and Perception checks for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nDebilitating Flurry:\n On a failed save, Debilitating Jabs additionally causes a -3 penalty to \n[Damage Reduction]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n\n\nPurge All Evil \nEX\n\n\nYour special Combat Maneuvers have surpassed their former limits:\n\n\n\n\nCrippling Palms:\n Crippling Jabs's minimum movement speed is now 0 ft.

A creature without a melee attack range threatens no area and cannot use melee attacks, and a creature without a ranged attack range cannot use ranged attacks. Remember that \n[Melee]\n range, which is not affected by Disabling Palms's penalties to melee attack range for purposes of ranged attack range, stands between \n[Close]\n range and no range.\n\n\nImpairing Palms:\n Impairing Jabs's minimum vision mode count is now 0.

It can be surprisingly effective, and foes are often caught off guard by a Drunken Brawler's unexpected competence. Aside from the brute force unlocked by being drunk, these Drunken Brawlers can also manifest effects reminiscent of the various stages of drunkenness in those they manage to hit.\n\n\nCondition: \n[Inebriated]\n\n\nThough you can hold your liquor well, you are undeniably drunk. Like a \n[Confused]\n creature, an \n[Inebriated]\n creature\u2019s actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESULT\n\n\nEFFECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-10\n\n\nSpend his standard or move action babbling incoherently\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11-30\n\n\nHave his movement speed halved for 1 \n[Round]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31-60\n\n\nTake offensive actions against the nearest enemy, moving toward it as necessary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61-100\n\n\nAct normally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn \n[Inebriated]\n creature who can\u2019t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. If an opponent takes an offensive action against an \n[Inebriated]\n creature, that creature takes offensive actions against that opponent on its next turn, moving toward it as necessary as long as it is still \n[Inebriated]\n when its turn comes. If remaining in an Area of Effect would cause harm to an \n[Inebriated]\n creature, it attempts to leave that Area of Effect so long as this would not prevent it from taking offensive actions against an opponent that has just attempted to harm it.\n\n\nAn \n[Inebriated]\n creature does not make Attacks of Opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). Unless otherwise noted, this condition expires at the end of the \n[Scene]\n. Any effect that can remove the \n[Confused]\n condition can remove the \n[Inebriated]\n condition.\n\n\nWeapon Property: \n[Disgusting]\n\n\nDisgusting weapons inflict \n[Sickened]\n on a critical hit.\n\n\n1st Circle - Spirit Spirit \nEX\n\n\nYou seem like a bumbling drunkard, which has its benefits. You are \n[Immune]\n to the \n[Confused]\n condition. Also, you are \n[Immune]\n to the \n[Nauseated]\n and \n[Sickened]\n conditions from any source other than this track and can never become completely \n[Immune]\n to those conditions. In combat encounters, you are permanently \n[Inebriated]\n.\n\n\nRaw Strength\n\n\nYour buzzed state has stripped away all inhibitions (and eliminated any hope of concentration).\n\n\nYour Unarmed Strike Natural weapon gains the \n[Brutal 3]\n, \n[Disgusting]\n, and \n[Magnum]\n properties. When wielding an Improvised weapon, you can grant it properties of your choice from your Unarmed Strike Natural weapon until it has 5 properties. The Improvised weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.\n\n\nYour bonuses to damage from the Deadly Aim and Power Attack Combat Maneuvers and Critical hits are doubled. Also, all bonus damage from the Deadly Aim and Power Attack Combat Maneuvers and Critical hits is \n[Precision]\n damage. Additionally, you cannot use the Precise Strike Combat Maneuver.\n\n\nAttacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional \n[Precision]\n damage equal to your level.\n\n\n2nd Circle - Imbibed Insight\n\n\nYour blurred vision and slurred speech belie a deepening grasp on your surroundings.  Your combat maneuvers, and opponents\u2019 attempts to escape or act in a \n[Grappled]\n or \n[Pinned]\n condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of Raw Strength:\n\n\nTrue Headbutt \nEX\n\n\nAs a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage.

You are \n[Immune]\n to the \n[Disabled]\n and \n[Dying]\n conditions. Additionally, you gain access to the following special Combat Maneuvers which benefit from the bonus damage from Raw Strength:\n\n\nDrunk Fist \nEX\n\n\nAs a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or become \n[Sickened]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nHangover Hook \nEX\n\n\nAs a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, you are \n[Sickened]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n. If this attack hits an opponent, the target must make a Fortitude save or become \n[Sickened]\n. If this attack hits an opponent who is \n[Immune]\n to the \n[Sickened]\n condition, the target must make a Fortitude save or become \n[Sickened]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n, ignoring their \n[Immunity]\n. If this attack hits a \n[Sickened]\n opponent, the target must make a Fortitude save or become \n[Nauseated]\n.\n\n\nIn addition, when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip, you may immediately make a \n[Bonus attack]\n.\n\n\n4th Circle - Ceaseless Flow \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Axe Kick, Disarm, Flying Strike, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this \n[Round]\n. If you replace a \n[Bonus attack]\n using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your \n[Bonus attack]\n for that \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n5th Circle - Stop the Breath \nEX\n\n\nYour combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Axe Kick, Disarm, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut, it is \n[Flat-footed]\n until the beginning of its next turn.\n\n\n6th Circle - Disjunction of the Alcoholic\n\n\nYou have learned how to dispel the magic known as sobriety. You gain access to the following special Combat Maneuver which benefits from the bonus damage of Raw Strength:\n\n\nTemulent Slam \nEX\n\n\nYou make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, you become \n[Nauseated]\n, and the target must make a Fortitude save or become both \n[Battered]\n and \n[Inebriated]\n. If the opponent fails their save, this attack doesn't qualify you as the target for the \n[Inebriated]\n condition's aggression rules.\n\n\n7th Circle - On Power \nEX\n\n\nYou can now use Ceaseless Flow any number of times per \n[Round]\n, and Stop the Breath now affects any opponent you hit with Axe Kick, Disarm, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut, regardless of whether they successfully save against it or not.\n\n\nDiscipline of the Mantis\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 External Techniques \nEX\n\n\nChoose five weapon properties other than \n[Arcane]\n, \n[Barbed]\n, \n[Distant]\n, \n[Hold-out]\n or \n[Quick-draw]\n. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon\u2019s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.\n\n\nAdditionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties\nyour Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses. You may grant it 2 such properties at 1st circle, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, and 5 at 7th. The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.\n\n\nAttacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the \n[Precision]\n descriptor equal to your level.\n\n\nc2 Raptor Stance\n\n\nYour combat maneuvers, and opponents\u2019 attempts to escape or act in a \n[Grappled]\n or \n[Pinned]\n condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques.\n\n\nRepeated Strikes \nEX\n\n\nYou strike your opponent several times in succession, adding injury after injury. As a standard action, make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. Compare your attack roll -5 to your opponent's AC. If this would still result in a hit, you deal an additional 1d6 damage.\n\n\nMantis Hook \nEX\n\n\nBy holding your arms in an unusual configuration, you are able to use them for attack as well as defense. As a standard action, make a single melee attack that deals normal damage.

Once per \n[Encounter]\n, you may make a single melee attack at your highest BAB as a move action. This attack suffers a -5 penalty to hit and may not be replaced with a combat maneuver, but otherwise follows all the normal rules for attacking.\n\n\nc4 Ceaseless Flow \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this \n[Round]\n. If you replace a \n[Bonus attack]\n using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your \n[Bonus attack]\n for that \n[Round ]\n.\n\n\nc5 Stop the Breath \nEX\n\n\nYour combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip, it is \n[Flat-footed]\n until the beginning of its next turn.\n\n\nC6 Mantis Perfection\n\n\nChoose one of the following abilities (this choice is permanent):\n\n\nPerfect Striking \nEX\n\n\nRepeated Strikes deals an additional 2d6 damage, rather than 1d6.

This is a [Positive] effect.\n\n\nThe Burden of Knowledge\n\n\nThe Judgment track is common to all paladins, and so is listed directly on the ability chart. You cannot multiclass into or out of Judgment. The\npaladin must also choose any one paladin track(other than Knowing) for the Dedication progression, and one other paladin track (other than Knowing) for the Oath progression.\n\n\nClass Tracks\n\n\nJudgment: The Seven Circles of Knowing\n\n\nIf you possess the Bastion track, all allies within the area of your Bastion Aura gain the Knowing ability from this track. At the beginning of each [Encounter], you may choose an ability you possess that is a [Bastion] effect. Until the end of the [Encounter], all allies within the area of your Bastion Aura gain that ability.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Knowing \nSU\n\n\nYou are aware, in the general sense, of the moral and ideological predilections of any sentient creature within a spread with a radius of 15 ft + 5 ft per Judgment circle you possess originating from you. This spread moves with you, is not a divination effect, and is always on. It does not automatically penetrate [Invisible], [Concealed], or Stealth, but if you can otherwise circumvent these effects, Knowing will function unimpeded. Likewise, you become aware of the likely major moral implications of your actions. Just how much you are aware of these implications is determined by the GM. You also gain a +4 bonus to Awareness and to Perception checks. This is a [Bastion] effect.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Mercy \nSU\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], as an immediate action or part of another immediate action, you may prevent up to three times your character level in damage that would be dealt to any ally within your Knowing. This can only be done as the damage is being dealt, but may be activated after you know exactly how much damage a given effect will deal. This is a [Bastion] effect.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Grace \nSU\n\n\nYou gain a +3 bonus to all saves, 2 additional HP per level, and gain [Immunity] to all [Fear] effects.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Requital \nSU\n\n\nOpponents who start moving within the range of your Knowing suffer a 20 ft penalty to their movement speed, for the purposes of that move. This does not affect 5 ft steps.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Light \nSU\n\n\nYou may now, at any time, illuminate the area around you out to the limit of the Knowing. This may be turned on or off as a free action. In addition, you gain [Blindsight] with a range equal to the radius of the Knowing. This is a [Bastion] effect.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Endurance \nSU\n\n\nThe first time in each [Encounter] that you fail a saving throw against a harmful effect, the effect is negated without affecting you. This is a [Bastion] effect.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Allegiance \nSU\n\n\nYou are indefatigable. You gain [Immunity] to [Mind-affecting], [Fatigued], [Exhausted], [Blown Away], [Stunned], [Dazed], and cannot be knocked [Prone].\n\n\nBastion: The Seven Circles of Protection\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 The Shield \nSU\n\n\nAs a swift action, you may create a spread with a radius of 10 ft plus 5 ft per two character levels you possess originating from you called the Bastion Aura. This spread moves with you.\n\n\nWhenever a spell of first circle or lower that has a duration targets you, if it is not a copy, you may project it. To project a spell, create a copy of that spell for each other ally within your Bastion Aura.\n\n\nThat spell and each of those copies become bonded to one another and gain \"When a [Dispelling] effect ends this spell, end all spells bonded to it\", that spell gains \"When this spell ends, end all spells bonded to it\", and each of those copies gains \"You gain this spell's effect only while you are within the Bastion Aura of the ally who created this spell\". Then you cast each of those copies targeting a different one of those allies. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity and counts as casting those spells only for the purpose of those spells' effects and abilities of this track.\n\n\nAs a swift action, you may end this spread.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 The Gauntlet \nSU\n\n\nWhenever a spell of 2nd circle of lower that has a duration targets you, if it is not a copy, you may project it.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 The Mantle \nSU\n\n\nWhenever a spell of third circle of lower that has a duration targets you, if it is not a copy, you may project it. Each [Encounter], the first [Dispelling] effect made against a bonded spell you cast fails.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 The Armor \nSU\n\n\nWhenever a spell of fourth circle of lower that has a duration targets you, if it is not a copy, you may project it. Additionally, each ally gains a +3 deflection bonus to AC as long as it is within the Bastion Aura.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 The Soul \nSU\n\n\nWhenever a spell of fifth circle of lower that has a duration targets you, if it is not a copy, you may project it. Each [Encounter], the second [Dispelling] effect made against a bonded spell you cast fails.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 The Ready \nSU\n\n\nEach ally gains a pool of points equal to half your character level. Without taking an action, an ally may spend any number of points from their pool after they know the numerical result of a single saving throw, attack roll or skill check they made to add a bonus to that roll equal to the number of points spent. These points may only be spent while the ally is affected by the Bastion Aura. The pool refreshes each [Scene].\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 The Strong \nSU\n\n\nWhen an ally within the Bastion Aura is reduced to -1 or fewer hit points from 0 or more hit points, it gains [Immunity] to [Dying], [Unconscious], [Stable], and [Dead] for one [Round].\n\n\nHeroica: The Seven Circles of Endings\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 The Blade and the Bow \nEX\n\n\nWhen you gain this ability, designate target ally other than yourself as your partner. (You also become its partner.) A creature with a partner cannot be designated as another creature's partner, and no creature can have more than one partner at a time.  Once per [Scene], you may designate a different ally other than yourself to be your partner. You and your partner both add half your respective levels to damage with your attacks (minimum 1). If your partner also has this ability, the damage bonuses stack.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Of Might and Guile \nEX\n\n\nChoose one of the following abilities (this choice is permanent):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMight\n: As a swift action, if your partner is within [Medium] range, you may deal damage equal to your KOM to all opponents within your [Close] range of your partner. This damage ignores [Immunity] and cannot be mitigated or reduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuile\n: You can spend a move action to double your partner's critical threat range for one [Round]. Your partner also gains this ability, but cannot use it in a [Round] where you have used it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 The Just and the Unjust \nEX\n\n\nYour partner gains the benefits of a Lesser item or Greater item you are attuned to as if they possessed a duplicate of that item and were attuned to it. You cannot choose a duplicate of an item to which your partner is already attuned.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 The Truth and the Folly \nEX\n\n\nWhenever you attack an opponent against which your partner took an offensive action within the last [Round], you may ignore the highest applicable [Miss chance]. Whenever your partner attacks an opponent against which you took an offensive action within the last [Round], your partner may ignore the highest applicable [Miss chance].\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 The Quick and the Dead \nEX\n\n\nWhile within your [Close] range, your partner gains [Resistance] to all damage dealt by opponents within your [Close] range.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Aleph and Null \nEX\n\n\nWhen either you or your partner kills an opponent, you each heal 25 HP and may each immediately take two 5 ft steps.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 With Your Shield or On It \nEX\n\n\nYou don't die until your partner would also be [Dead]. This only works if you are within 100 ft of each other, and have line of effect. If either of those conditions ceases to be met, you die instantly if this ability was currently sustaining you. If your partner has this ability, it does not make you immortal.\n\n\nSmiting: The Seven Circles of War\n\n\nAll bonuses from this track are fury bonuses, which stack with other fury bonuses from this track. At the beginning of your turn, you may choose not to benefit from fury bonuses to attack rolls, damage and save DCs until the beginning of your next turn. Attacks and abilities that benefit from a fury bonus to attack rolls, damage or save DCs cannot also deal damage with the [Precision] descriptor.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Skirmish \nEX\n\n\nWhen you miss on an attack roll against an opponent, add a +1 bonus to your attack rolls for the duration of the [Encounter]. This bonus stacks with itself up to the higher of 2 or your level, but cannot be added to more than once per attack.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Conflict \nEX\n\n\nYour attacks gain a bonus to damage equal to your Charisma modifier.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Struggle \nEX\n\n\nThe second time you hit a single opponent during your turn, you gain a bonus to damage against that opponent equal to your Charisma modifier for one [Round]. The fourth time you hit an opponent during your turn, your bonus to damage against that opponent from this ability increases to twice your Charisma modifier. (These bonuses apply to damage from the attacks with which you hit the second and fourth time.)\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Escalation \nEX\n\n\nWhenever your Struggle ability activates, you may inflict the [Battered] condition for one [Round] on the opponent you hit to activate Struggle. The duration of this condition increases by one [Round] for every time you hit the opponent again. Additionally, once per [Round], if you hit a [Battered] opponent with an attack, that opponent becomes [Dazed] for one [Round]. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier) negates the [Dazed] condition.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Annihilation \nEX\n\n\nWhen you Charge, your attacks gain a bonus to damage equal to your Charisma modifier for the duration of the [Encounter]. This ability stacks with itself up to two times.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Scorched Earth \nEX\n\n\nIf you are reduced to less than half of your normal maximum HP, your attacks gain a bonus to damage equal to your Charisma modifier for the duration of the [Encounter] or until you are healed above that threshold.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 War Engine \nEX\n\n\nWhenever you hit an opponent with an attack, that opponent becomes [Battered] and suffers a penalty to its AC equal to your Charisma modifier until the end of the [Encounter].\n\n\nVirtue: The Seven Circles of Renewal\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Font \nSU\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], you may draw up an immobile wellspring of vitality called a font, which manifests as a low steady hum and a single spark of light. As a swift action, you may place it anywhere within 10 ft + 5 ft per two character levels. Each [Round], at the start of your turn, an arc of restorative energy strikes one ally of your choice within your [Close] range of the font, and heals 2 HP plus your character level and your Charisma modifier. A font expires after a number of [Rounds] equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 2). Fonts do not occupy a square, and cannot be targeted or affected by anything but the Virtue track abilities of their creator.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Icon \nEX\n\n\nYou may now place up to two fonts per [Encounter], using a separate swift action to place each.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Dawnsign \nEX\n\n\nFonts you place now persist for a number of [Rounds] equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum 4 [Rounds]), and an additional font emanates from you passively, beginning on your first turn each [Encounter].\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Vitality Engine \nSU\n\n\nIf any portion of the HP healed by an arc would have no effect on a target due to his or her HP being full, instead of simply being wasted, that target gains temporary HP equal to the amount of healing that would have normally had no effect. Unlike normal temporary HP, this stacks to a maximum of half the target's normal max HP. This temporary HP lasts for the duration of the [Encounter].\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Holy Glyph \nSU\n\n\nInstead of its normal benefit, an arc from one of your fonts may be used to expunge any one of the following conditions: [Shaken], [Entangled], [Nauseated], [Dazzled], [Deafened], [Blinded], or [Sickened].\n\n\nYou can trigger and direct a single arc from one of your fonts as a swift action, in addition to the normal arcs at the beginning of your turn.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Star Spark \nSU\n\n\nAn arc may be used to expunge any one of the following conditions instead of healing: [Stunned], [Slowed], [Battered], or [Dazed]. Additionally, any time you use your swift action to generate an additional arc, you may destroy any one of your fonts to create an arc that heals 50 points of damage and [Teleport] that ally anywhere within range of a remaining font. You may not destroy the font emanating from your person.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Rebirth \nSU\n\n\nYou may destroy a font as part of your swift action to generate an arc that revives a [Dead] ally, healing the ally to 50 hit points in the process (if the ally's maximum hit points are less than 50, he gains the rest as temporary HP). If you opt to do this, you may not destroy a font with Star Spark as part of the same action. You may not destroy the font emanating from your person.",

Rangers are capable trappers and huntsmen, but can also be skilled swordfighters proficient in an exotic fighting style.\n\n\nAttack and Save Progression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nBAB\n\n\nGood Saves\n\n\nPoor Saves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n7\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n8\n\n\n7\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n8\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n8\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n11\n\n\n9\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n12\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n13\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n14\n\n\n11\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n15\n\n\n12\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n16\n\n\n12\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n17\n\n\n13\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n18\n\n\n14\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n19\n\n\n14\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n20\n\n\n15\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n21\n\n\n16\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n22\n\n\n16\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n23\n\n\n17\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n24\n\n\n18\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n25\n\n\n18\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n26\n\n\n19\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n27\n\n\n20\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n28\n\n\n21\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n29\n\n\n21\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n30\n\n\n22\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Features\n\n\nFavored Enemy\n\n\nYou have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.\nChoose a type of favored enemy: \n\n Aberrations\n\n Beasts\n\n Celestials\n\n Constructs\n\n Dragons\n\n Elementals\n\n Fey\n\n Fiends\n\n Giants\n\n Monstrosities\n\n Oozes\n\n Plants\n* Undead\n\n\nAlternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.\n\n\nYou have advantage on checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on all Knowledge checks to recall information about them.\n\n\nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.\n\n\nNatural Explorer\n\n\nYou are intimately familiar with a type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions.\n\n\nChoose one type of favored terrain:\n\n\n\n\nArctic\n\n\nCoast\n\n\nDesert\n\n\nForest\n\n\nGrassland\n\n\nMountain\n\n\nSwamp\n\n\n\n\nWhen you make a Geography or Nature check related to your favored terrain you have advantage.\n\n\nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:\n\n Difficult terrain doesn\u2019t slow your group\u2019s travel.\n\n Your group can\u2019t become lost except by magical means.\n\n Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger--you never take a penalty to Awareness for distraction during travel.\n\n If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\n\n When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.\n\n While tracking other creatures, on a success you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.\n\n\nRanger's Tactics\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Reap the Whirlwind \nEX\n\n\nYou can, with minimal preparation and using only the resources at hand, create deadly ambushes for your enemy. You can prepare traps, which can be deployed in combat as a swift action. You can deploy one trap per [Encounter], plus one more for every four character levels you possess. A trap will remain functional until the end of the [Encounter], with some exceptions. Every trap has a unique effect when sprung, and while traps are normally visible, they can be concealed with the Larceny skill (as explained in Section VII). At 1st circle, you have access to the following traps:\n\n\nTanglefoot Paste\n\n\nAtomized in a fine mist that hovers in the air, this paste covers up to five squares in [Close] range of you at time of deployment. Each affected square must touch at least one other affected square. Targets entering these squares must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1\u20442 your level + your KOM), or stop their movement and become [Flat-footed] until their next turn.\n\n\nTripwire\n\n\nA tripwire is stretched across a 30ft line originating from target square within [Medium] range. The entire tripwire must exist entirely within your [Medium] range.\n\n\nThose attempting to leave a square covered by the line fall [Prone]. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 +1\u20442 your level + your KOM) negates the [Prone] condition. A tripwire can only trigger twice before being destroyed utterly.\n\n\nFumigator\n\n\nA fumigator can be thrown to any square inside [Medium] range, creating a 20ft radius spread of with a thin gas that has mild hallucinogenic effects originating from that square. For each creature, whenever that creature begins its turn inside the spread or thefirst time each [Round] that creature enters the spread, that creature starts seeing double, forcing it to treat all creatures as [Fully concealed] for the next 2 [Rounds]. A successful Will save (DC 10 +1\u20442 your level + your KOM) negates this effect.\n\n\nA fumigator dissipates after 4 [Rounds].\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 A Personal Touch \nEX\n\n\nGrappling hooks are standard-issue for rangers, and for good reason. Once per [Round], you may replace an attack made during your attack action with a ranged attack at up to [Close] range at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack. If you hit, you deal damage equal to 1d8 + your KOM and knock the hit opponent [Prone]. As a swift action, you may then immediately pull the opponent closer to you by up to 10ft + 5ft per 4 levels you possess. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1\u20442 your level + your KOM) negates the [Prone] condition and thus prevents the pull.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Kept Secret, Kept Safe \nEX\n\n\nAt will, you may use a move action to lay down a cloaking scatter of smoke, dust, and silvered shards to screen your allies. All allies within [Close] range gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex saves for one [Round]. At 12th level, the bonus rises to +3 and rises again to +4 at 18th.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 A Swiftness in the Blood \nEX\n\n\nOnce per [Round], you may take an additional swift or immediate action.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Into the Valley of Death \nEX\n\n\nAs an immediate action, when a creature triggers one of your traps, you may place another trap. is trap may not be placed directly under the unfortunate soul who triggered this ability. You gain access to the following additional traps:\n\n\nRazorpod Cluster\n\n\nOnce activated, this ominous metallic tangleweed splits into three razorpods \u2014 whirring collections of razor edges deployed to three separate squares within [Close] range. At the beginning of your turn, each razorpod you have deployed can move up to half your movement speed. Razorpods can move into a creature\u2019s occupied square and creatures can move into a square that a razorpod is in, but due to their tendency to get caught on anything, two razorpods cannot share the same square. Whenever a creature moves into a square occupied by a razorpod for that creature\u2019sfirst time this [Round], or at the end of your turn if at least one razorpod occupies the same square as a creature, that creature is dealt damage equal to your level plus your KOM.\n\n\nThis damage ignores [Damage reduction] and [Resistance]. After dealing damage three times, a razorpod is utterly destroyed.\n\n\nRemote mine\n\n\nRemote mines exist for the sole purpose of delivering cleverly timed pillars of cheery and warmth-giving re hot enough to melt steel. Each prepared remote mine can be deployed in target square within [Close] range. As an immediate action, you may detonate a remote mine to create a 15ft radius spread originating from the mine\u2019s square that deals four times your character level in energy damage with the [Fire] descriptor and in icts the [Battered] condition for two [Rounds] against all opponents within the spread. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1\u20442 your character level + your KOM) halves the damage.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Bring the Rain \nEX\n\n\nAs a move action, if you have a means of communicating with a creature, you provide that creature with targeting information for its abilities. is lets the creature use your location instead of its location for purposes of determining line of sight, line of effect, and range when calculating whether it can target a location or creature with one of its spells or abilities. This ability works over any distance. Each [Round] that you retain a Stealth check\u2019s result, including the [Round] you make your Stealth check, penalties to Stealth incurred by the creature currently benefiting from the ability are also incurred by you. You may maintain this effect for as many [Rounds] as you wish by spending a move action each [Round] you wish to maintain this effect.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 The Sound of Cannon \nEX\n\n\nYou become as swift as the terrible thunder you herald. You gain a +6 bonus to your initiative, and all allies gain a +4 bonus to their initiative, bringing your total bonus to +10.\n\n\nDaggers and Bolts\n\n\nChoose one of the combat styles below to represent the way your Ranger dominates the battlefield.\n\n\nA Reign of Arrows\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Dead-eye\n\n\nYou fight best when you don\u2019t fight fair. When you hit a [Flat-footed] opponent with a ranged attack, you deal 1 additional damage with the [Precision] descriptor per character level you possess.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Return Fire\n\n\nOnce per [Round], when an opponent within [Close] range attacks you, you may make a ranged attack against that opponent that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If your attack hits, it deals damage equal to your character level and leaves your target [Flat-footed] for one [Round].\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Ricochet\n\n\nYou can intercept any sort of projectile, given a chance. As an immediate action, you can intercept and hinder any ranged attack, spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability that would target or affect an ally within [Close] range. Make an attack roll with a ranged weapon you are wielding. For purposes of that offensive action, the ally can freely choose to replace its Armor Class or any saves it makes with your attack roll.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Missile Barrage\n\n\nEach attack you make is part of a carefully planned pattern of fire. Immediately after taking an attack action in which all attacks are made against target creature, you may create a spread with a radius of 5 ft per 5 levels you possess originating from target creature, causing each creature in the area besides target creature to be [Blown away] in a direction of your choice.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 A Crashing of Heaven\n\n\nYou learn to take aim, steady your breathing, and unleash devastation on your foe. Twice per [Encounter], as a move action, your next ranged attack this [Round] deals additional damage equal to four times your character level if it hits. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) halves the additional damage and prevents that attack from reducing your target below 1 HP. Whether it hits or misses, this attack inflicts the [Battered] condition on your target. This is a [Death] effect.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Storm Bolt\n\n\nOnce per [Round], as a swift action, you may make your next ranged attack this [Round] into a Storm Bolt; if the attack hits, your target becomes [Dazed] for one [Round]. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 +\u00bd your character level + your Key Offensive Modifier) negates the [Dazed] condition.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Thus Always Unto\n\n\nAs a swift action, you can sap the will and ability of your opponents with every strike; until the end of your turn, whenever you hit an opponent with a ranged attack, you may inflict the [Energy drained] condition on that opponent. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates the [Energy drained] condition and instead leaves the opponent [Flat-footed] for one [Round].\n\n\nPath of the Solar Wind\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Solar Storm\n\n\nYou gain the mighty Solar Storm. This is a [Ranged] weapon with 3 weapon properties of your choice plus the [Elemental Fire] property, and is a Lesser Item of your design with enchantments as normal for a magic weapon of its tier, but does not count against your normal limit for attuned magic items. When you reach 4th circle in this track, you redesign this weapon as a Greater Item, and when you reach 6th circle, redesign it as a Relic. Additionally, you gain a bonus on Perception checks equal to the number of circles you have in this track.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Solar Reflection\n\n\nOnce per [Round], as a standard action, make a number of ranged attacks up to the number of circles you possess in this track. Each attack must be made against a different target. The first attack deals normal damage, and each successive attack deals the same amount as the previous, plus an additional amount of [Fire] damage equal to your KOM. You cannot make any attacks outside of this ability in the same round that you use this ability. (So, no [Bonus Attacks], no Song of Arrows, no A Stitch in Time, etc...) \n\n\nAs an example, if you use this ability when you have 3 circles of this track, then you can make up to 3 attacks. The first deals regular damage, the second deals additional damage equal to your KOM, and the third deals additional damage equal to twice your KOM.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 True Shot Stance\n\n\nOnce per [Round], you may use the in-combat use of the perception skill without using an action. You gain a +2 to hit any enemy affected by the in-combat use of the perception skill.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Dazzling Solar Flare\n\n\nWhen you make a successful ranged attack against an enemy, that enemy becomes [Dazzled] for one [Round] and [Burning]. \n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Solar Meteor Blow\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], as a standard action, make a ranged attack against an enemy. That attack deals additional damage with the [Fire] descriptor equal to twice your level, and knocks the target and all enemies within your [Close] range of the target [Prone]. A reflex save negates the [Prone] condition.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Twisting Wind Shot\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], for one [Round], all attacks you make are critical hits as long as they would hit without this ability.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Solar Wind Nova\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], as a standard action, make a ranged attack against an enemy. If it hits, that enemy and all other enemies within [Close] range of that enemy take 6 times your level in [Fire] damage. A successful reflex save halves the damage.\n\n\nDeath from the Sky\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Ricochet\n\n\nOnce per [Round], as a swift action, when you hit an opponent with a ranged attack and deal damage to that opponent with that attack, you may create a wedge with a length up to 10ft originating from the target. Compare your attack roll from that attack to the AC of another target opponent within that wedge. If the attack roll equals or exceeds that opponent\u2019s AC, you deal damage to that opponent equal to the damage dealt by the attack. This ability is not an attack, and the maximum length of the wedge you create increases by 5ft every 3 levels you have.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Volley\n\n\nIf you would make one or more ranged attacks during your standard action, you may add the [Volley] descriptor to a single one of those attacks; this attack with the [Volley] descriptor is applied against every opponent in [Melee] range of your target.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Shooting Gallery\n\n\nOnce per [Round], as a standard action, make a number of ranged attacks up to the number of circles you possess in this track. Each attack must be made against a different target. The first attack deals normal damage, and each successive attack deals the same amount as the previous, plus an additional amount of damage equal to your KOM. You cannot make any attacks outside of this ability in the same round that you use this ability.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Disabling Impact\n\n\nWhen you damage a target and activate Ricochet, the initial target of that attack is [Slowed] for 1 [Round]. A successful fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 level + KOM) leaves the opponent [Entangled] for 1 [Round] instead.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 High Impact Grenade\n\n\nEnemies damaged by your Shooting Gallery attacks are knocked [Prone]. A reflex save (10 + 1/2 Level + KOM) negates the [Prone] condition.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Greater Ricochet\n\n\nActivating Ricochet no longer requires a swift action and may be used three times per [Round], though still only once per attack.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Darken the Skies\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter] you may make a ranged attack for each circle you possess in this track. For each such attack, choose a target square. All attacks you make during this action possess the [Volley] descriptor and target each creature within a 25ft spread of target square.\n\n\nIron Magi\n\n\nBy connecting a sequence of attacks and arcane abilities, called a Chain, you can call on the powerful abilities known as Chain Finishers.\n\n\nYour Chain has a length of zero at the beginning of each [Encounter]. A chain is measured by the number of Links in it. Whenever you make a successful melee attack, you may add one Link to your Chain. Iron Magi abilities called Chain components add one Link to your Chain whenever they are activated, even if they include attacks within them. Each Chain component is activated during an attack action to replace one or more melee attacks in that attack action, and each can be activated once per [Round]. Attacks made as part of a Chain component cannot be replaced as part of another Chain component.\n\n\nEach Chain Finisher can be activated as a swift action once per [Round], and can only be activated if the Chain has a certain number of Links or more, speci ed in the text of each ability. As part of each Chain Finisher, you may [Teleport] up to 5ft per Link in the Chain, which lets you close gaps and bring home the attack. You can choose to [Teleport] before or after the effect of the Chain Finisher, and this [Teleport] does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Activating a Chain Finisher ends the current Chain, reducing the number of Links in it to zero.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 A Cadence of Blows \nEX\n\n\nFrom the Tempo comes the simplest Chain component, which trades immediate opportunities for a long-term advantage by throwing an opponent off balance. A Cadence of Blows replaces a single melee attack in an attack action, and when activated grants you a +1 bonus to attack rolls against a single opponent within [Melee] range and a +1 bonus to AC. These bonuses stack twice at 1st circle, three times at 3rd circle, four times at 5th circle, and five times at 7th circle.\n\n\nA Cadence of Blows can also be activated as a Chain Finisher when you have a chain of at least one Link long.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Howl of the North Wind \nSU\n\n\nThis explosion of the biting and arctic burst wind can be activated as a Chain Finisher that requires at least one Link in your Chain. You create a 30ft radius spread originating from you that deals damage equal to your character level to all opponents in the area and renders them [Blown away] or [Prone], at your choice. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1\u20442 your level + your KOM) negates the [Blown away] or [Prone] conditions.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Beloved of the Dirae \nSU\n\n\nYou gain a [Bonus attack] whenever you take an attack action. \n\n\nIn addition, you may call on the principle of lightning through the spirits of celestial anger called Dirae. This is a Chain component that replaces two melee attacks in an attack action to strike an opponent with a rain of sparks. \n\n\nYou may make a single melee attack against a creature within your [Medium] range. Regardless of whether the attack hits or misses, you create a 35ft radius spread originating from your target that lasts for one [Round]. For each opponent, the first time that opponent moves into or begins its turn in this spread, it takes energy damage with the [Electricity] descriptor equal to your character level + KOM. Opponents in the spread at the end of the spread\u2019s duration are dealt double this amount of damage.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Scream of the Black Sky \nSU\n\n\nWith the festering darkness of the second wind, you conjure a swirl of violent black clouds as a Chain Finisher that requires at least two Links in your chain. Up to three target opponents within your [Close] range take damage equal to twice your character level + KOM, and are [Blinded] for two [Rounds]. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1\u20442 your level + your KOM) halves the [Blinded] duration. Scream of the Black Sky may be activated three times per [Encounter].\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Staccato Blastwave \nSU\n\n\nAs a Chain component that replaces two melee attacks in an attack action, you invoke the Principle of thunder to create a ripple of violent sound that shatters bone and tears flesh. You make a single melee attack, which deals damage as normal, plus additional damage equal to three times your character level plus your KOM. If the attack misses, you still deal this additional damage to the target.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Bellow of the Deep Earth \nSU\n\n\nRoaring and sudden, you call forth the underground current of the third wind as a Chain Finisher that requires at least three Links in your chain. You create a 50ft radius spread originating from you that deals damage equal to three times your character level to all opponents in the area and renders them [Prone] and [Entangled]. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1\u20442 your level + your KOM) negates the [Prone] and [Entangled] conditions. Bellow of the Deep Earth may be activated three times per [Encounter].\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Mastery of Law\n\n\nAs the curious tenets of your art become obvious to you, you begin to grasp a great and terrible truth. You gain the following abilities.\n\n\nMagnum Opus \nEX\n\n\nAll of your Chain components and successful melee attacks add an additional Link to your Chain.\n\n\nRoar of the Storm Lords\nSU\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], you may activate this ability as a Chain Finisher that requires at least seven Links in your Chain. You create a spread with a radius of your [Medium] range originating from you, which deals damage equal to three times your character level to all opponents in the area, and renders them [Battered] for two [Rounds], knocks them [Prone], and repositions each of them up to 70ft each to squares of your choice. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1\u20442 your level + your Key O ensive Modifier) negates the repositioning effect and the [Prone] condition.\n\n\nOther Tracks\n\n\nBattle\u2019s Tempering\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Rather Quick than Dead\n\n\nMoving out of a square of difficult terrain does not cost you extra movement. In addition, choose one of the following options. This choice is permanent:\n\n\nShoot First\n\n\nYou gain a bonus equal to half your level (minimum 1) on initiative checks.\n\n\nGain Ground\n\n\nYou can take an additional 5 ft step each [Round].\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Dive For Cover\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], when you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an offensive action that would normally have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as a spell with a save of \u201cReflex half \u201d), you instead ignore the effect entirely.\n\n\nAdditionally, once per [Encounter] when you succeed on a reflex save, you become [Covered] for 1 [Round]\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 For Ire\n\n\nYou gain [Fast healing] equal to your Key Defensive Modifier, and becoming [Flat-footed] does not prevent you from making attacks of opportunity or taking immediate actions.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 The Look of a Survivor\n\n\nYou gain [Resistance] to physical damage.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 It Has Been an Honor\n\n\nYou are a true expert at getting the hell out of Dodge. You gain [Immunity] to [Binding] effects. In addition, once per [Round], as a move action or as part of a move action, you can fade into your environment, duplicating the effects of the invisibility spell.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Ghost\n\n\nYou resist magical and technological attempts to locate you. Items, spells, and supernatural and spell-like abilities cannot be used to establish line of sight to you. Divination spells cannot be used to track or locate you. Additionally, you ignore bonuses to opponents\u2019 Awareness from items, spells, and supernatural and spell-like abilities.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 A Masterpiece in Violence\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], if you would take 60 or more damage from a single attack, effect, or ability, you may immediately make an attack action against the source of the damage. The target is [Flat-footed] for this attack action. If this attack action kills your target, you take no damage.",

As part of each Chain Finisher, you may [Teleport] up to 5ft per Link in the Chain, which lets you close gaps and bring home the attack. You can choose to [Teleport] before or after the effect of the Chain Finisher, and this [Teleport] does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Whether by nature or nurture, rogues develop a wide range of talents, though any given rogue has a preference for certain aspects of that spectrum. These unorthodox fighting styles make rogues dangerous and unpredictable opponents, and they often relish in their enemies' confusion. A rogue's vast arsenal of tricks means they can keep their enemies guessing until the final blow. Some rogues like to make elaborate plans, depending on personal skill and expertise; others play it fast and loose, relying on their luck when everything goes sour. \n\n\nParty Role\n\n\nRogues are excellent at dealing lots of damage while remaining mobile. A rogue should always be on the lookout for her next target, and deliver devastating blows where they count most. As a class that trains many skills, rogues are versatile characters both in and out of combat. \n\n\nRogues in Your Game\n\n\nWhile it might be tempting to make all rogues some kind of thief, they can also serve as excellent scouts, pirates, musketeers, duelists, or undercover detectives. A rogue's many skills make them excellent experts of almost any profession.\n\n\nAttack and Save Progression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nBAB\n\n\nRef\n\n\nGood Save\n\n\nPoor Save\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+0\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+1\n\n\n+3\n\n\n+3\n\n\n+1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n+2\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n+3\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n+3\n\n\n+5\n\n\n+5\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n+4\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n+5\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+7\n\n\n+7\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n+6\n\n\n+8\n\n\n+8\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n+7\n\n\n+8\n\n\n+8\n\n\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n+8\n\n\n+9\n\n\n+9\n\n\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n+9\n\n\n+10\n\n\n+10\n\n\n+6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n+9\n\n\n+10\n\n\n+10\n\n\n+6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n+10\n\n\n+11\n\n\n+11\n\n\n+7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n+11\n\n\n+12\n\n\n+12\n\n\n+7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n+12\n\n\n+12\n\n\n+12\n\n\n+8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n+12\n\n\n+13\n\n\n+13\n\n\n+8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n+13\n\n\n+14\n\n\n+14\n\n\n+9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n+14\n\n\n+14\n\n\n+14\n\n\n+9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n+15\n\n\n+15\n\n\n+15\n\n\n+10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Features\n\n\nTechnician or Warrior\n\n\nRogues are either unsurpassed experts in skills or able combatants. At 1st level, a rogue chooses between either a Good Base Attack Bonus (equal to level) or 2 additional trained skills (bringing their base number of trained skills to 8). This choice is permanent. \n\n\nHardy or Resolute\n\n\nIn addition, rogues can choose between being slippery tricksters or hardy thugs. Choose one of Will or Fortitude; that save is a Good save for you, and the other is Poor. Reflex is always a Good save for rogues. This choice is permanent.\n\n\nRogue Tactics\n\n\nEach rogue chooses a single track's worth of offensive class features and a single track's worth of defensive class features. You choose both your offensive and defensive track at 1st level. Once made, these choices are permanent. Unless stated otherwise, rogue abilities are extraordinary and can be used at will.\n\n\nThe variety inherent to these tracks means that rogues vary in their Key Ability Modifiers. Your choice of offensive track determines your Key Offensive Modifier, and your choice of defensive track determines your Key Defensive Modifier. If you multiclass out of one of these tracks, you may choose any ability modifier for the KOM (for rogues without an offensive track) or KDM (for rogues without a defensive track); of course, the two modifiers must still be linked to different abilities. \n\n\nThe Gift\n\n\nWhile rogues can choose different offensive and defensive tracks, there is a certain essence that defines a rogue. Either they are masters of their craft, or sly rogues that seem to be making it up as they go along. A rogue must choose between the Esoterica Radica and the Esoterica Adeptus. This choice is permanent. These paths are unique to Rogues and cannot be traded away via multiclassing (or accessed via multiclassing).\n\n\nOffensive Track\n\n\nPick one of the following tracks. You gain the abilities of your chosen track in order, at the level shown in the table for your class.\n\n\nAssassin\n\n\nRogues who choose the Assassin track focus on their ability to set up devastating strikes from cover or stealth. Eventually, they learn to destroy crowds just as efficiently as they would eliminate a lone guardsman. Your Key Offensive Modifier is Dexterity, as appropriate for a stealthy character.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Sneak Attack \nEX\n\n\nYou know that a fair fight is a failure to plan. Any time you make an attack that hits a \n[Flat-footed]\n, \n[Helpless]\n, \n[Confused]\n, \n[Dazed]\n, \n[Entangled]\n, \n[Exhausted]\n, \n[Stunned]\n, \n[Shaken]\n, \n[Frightened]\n, \n[Cowering]\n or \n[Panicked]\n target, you deal 1d6 additional damage with the \n[Precision]\n descriptor per Assassin circle that you possess, to a maximum of 7d6.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Slayer's Sense \nEX\n\n\nOnce you go for an enemy, you're rarely inclined to let them escape alive. You can ignore \n[Concealed]\n and \n[Fully concealed]\n when attacking an opponent you have previously damaged with Sneak Attack during the \n[Encounter]\n.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Blood Calls to Blade \nEX\n\n\nAny time you make an attack against an opponent subject to your Sneak Attack ability while you are not benefiting from fury bonuses to attack rolls, save DCs, or damage, you gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Menacing Presence \nEX\n\n\nThe sight of one of your victims leaves their allies disturbed and vulnerable. Whenever an opponent ends its turn within your \n[Melee]\n range of another creature you have damaged with a Sneak Attack during this \n[Encounter]\n, it becomes \n[Shaken]\n for one \n[Round]\n. This is a \n[Mind-affecting]\n, \n[Fear]\n effect.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Felling Strike \nEX\n\n\nThe shock of a Sneak Attack often causes an enemy to open their defenses. Whenever you deal additional damage with the \n[Precision]\n descriptor to an opponent within \n[Melee]\n range with your Sneak Attack ability, that opponent is knocked \n[Prone]\n. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the \n[Prone]\n condition.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Battle Fatigue \nEX\n\n\nEven if an enemy survives your first strikes, you still leave their body battered and crippled. If you deal Sneak Attack damage to an opponent twice in the same \n[Round]\n, that opponent is \n[Slowed]\n until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 No Exit \nEX\n\n\nHell is one other person in particular \u2014 you. Twice per \n[Encounter]\n, as a swift action, you may deal additional damage equal to 5x your level on your next Sneak Attack this \n[Round]\n, and cause the target to be \n[Blinded]\n and \n[Stunned]\n for one \n[Round]\n. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) halves the additional damage and causes the opponent to become \n[Dazzled]\n and \n[Entangled]\n, instead of being \n[Stunned]\n and \n[Blinded]\n. This is a \n[Death]\n effect.\n\n\nSwashbuckler\n\n\nRogues who choose the Swashbuckler track focus on elegant, mobile combat, preferably one-on-one so that they can isolate an opponent and show off properly. Your Key Offensive Modifier is Dexterity, since you value quick mobility and finesse.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Dance With Me \nEX\n\n\nWhenever you move at least 10 ft, your next attack this \n[Round]\n deals additional damage with the \n[Precision]\n descriptor equal to your KDM plus your character level.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Once More! \nEX\n\n\nWhen you spend a standard action to make a single attack that is not part of a spell-like ability or spell, and then move at least 10 ft during the same \n[Round]\n, you may make a single melee attack at the end of your movement. This attack, called a \nOnce More!\n attack, can be made another time at the end of each additional instance of movement after moving at least 10 more ft. The required distance may comprise a single movement or multiple movements (such as a pair of 5 ft steps), but a \nOnce More!\n attack can only be made when a movement ends. If the movement is made as part of an action, you can likewise only activate \nOnce More!\n at the end of that action. At 2nd circle you may only make one \nOnce More!\n attack per \n[Round]\n. This expands to two Once More! attacks per \n[Round]\n at 4th circle, and three Once More! attacks per \n[Round]\n at 6th circle.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Dirty Fighting \nEX\n\n\nYour speed and finesse leave opponents demoralized and bruised, even before they are defeated. The first time you hit any opponent with a \nOnce More!\n attack this \n[Round]\n, your opponent becomes \n[Battered]\n for two \n[Rounds]\n. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the \n[Battered]\n condition.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Kick Him While He's Down \nEX\n\n\nOnce you begin to throw down, you have a knack of taking the advantage and running with it. Once per \n[Round]\n, after making an attack during your turn, you may immediately take two free 5 ft steps (even if you used or will use a move action to move) and make a \n[Bonus attack]\n.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Concussive Impact \nEX\n\n\nYou disorient your opponents with lightning-fast strikes. If you hit an opponent with two \nOnce More!\n attacks in the same \n[Round]\n, they become \n[Confused]\n for one \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Panache \nEX\n\n\nYou mercilessly take advantage of openings in your opponents' defenses. Any time an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you may move 10 ft in any direction before making your attack of opportunity. In addition, every time you hit an opponent with a \nOnce More!\n attack, you may move the target 10 ft in any direction. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Topsy Turvy \nEX\n\n\nSometimes you roll with the punches and sometimes the punches roll with you. Your Panache ability may now move each opponent within your \n[Melee]\n range after you hit an opponent with a \nOnce More!\n attack instead of just the opponent hit. Once per \n[Round]\n for each opponent moved, if your opponent is adjacent to an obstacle or occupied square and you are able to push them 5 ft or further, you may forgo any further movement from that activation of Panache to render that opponent \n[Prone]\n. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the \n[Prone]\n condition.\n\n\nDemo Man\n\n\nRogues who choose the Demo Man track rely on their ability to destroy all obstacles in their path. Your Key Offensive Modifier is Intelligence, as the strength of your explosives largely depends on your skill in making them.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Smells Like Victory \nEX\n\n\nYou love the smell of freshly mixed exposives in the morning. Or afternoon. Or evening, for that matter. Choose an elemental descriptor (\n[Acid]\n, \n[Cold]\n, \n[Electricity]\n, or \n[Fire]\n). This choice is permanent. As a move action or a swift action, you can mix noxious chemicals into a vial, which lasts for one \n[Round]\n, at which point it becomes useless.\n\n\nThese vials can be thrown as attacks in an attack action, and you can throw as many vials per \n[Round]\n as you have vials to throw, as a ranged attack (\n[Close]\n range), with an item bonus to the attack roll equal to the number of Demo Man circles you possess. A target hit by the vial takes energy damage with the chosen descriptor equal to 1d4 per level you possess, plus your Key Offensive Modifier, and starts \n[Burning]\n. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the \n[Burning]\n condition.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Flashbang \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, as part of a move action, you can add a fuse to a powerful firecracker, which lasts for one \n[Round]\n before its volatile chemicals become useless. You can use the firecracker in either of the following ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlash Grenade:\n As a ranged attack, which can be made as part of an attack action, you can throw the firecracker at target square within \n[Close]\n range, which creates a 10 ft radius spread originating from that square. All creatures within the spread are \n[Blinded]\n\nand \n[Deafened]\n for two \n[Rounds]\n. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the \n[Blinded]\n and \n[Deafened]\n conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlash Missile:\n You can affix the firecracker to a single ranged weapon in your possession or a vial prepared with your Smells Like\nVictory ability. The next time you hit a creature with an attack using either that weapon or vial, that creature is \n[Blinded]\n and \n[Deafened]\n for one \n[Round]\n. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the \n[Blinded]\n and \n[Deafened]\n conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Sticky Bomb \nEX\n\n\nIt dawns on you that you might want to ensure a safer escape. Once per \n[Encounter]\n per 4 character levels, without spending an action, you can affix a pouch of entangling goo to a single ranged weapon in your possession or a vial prepared with your Smells Like Victory ability. The next time you hit a creature with that weapon or vial before the beginning of your next turn, that creature and all creatures within a 20 ft radius spread originating from that creature are \n[Entangled]\n for two \n[Rounds]\n. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the \n[Entangled]\n condition.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 High Explosive \nEX\n\n\nYour most spectacular creation yet is so volatile you'd be a fool to carry more than one... so you carry two. Twice per \n[Encounter]\n, as a standard action, you may create a 30 ft radius spread originating from target square within \n[Close]\n range, which deals 1d6 damage per level plus your KOM to creatures within the area and pushes them to the closest square outside of it, knocks them \n[Prone]\n, and leaves them \n[Dazed]\n for one \n[Round]\n. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the \n[Dazed]\n condition and halves the damage.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Sapper Rods \nEX\n\n\nYou've created bombs that undermine magic itself.

Once per \n[Encounter]\n, as a standard action, you can detonate a cluster bomb in any square within \n[Close]\n range, creating a 30 ft radius spread originating from target square. This cluster bomb has three of the following effects of your choice:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVitriol:\n Creatures in the spread take energy damage with the elemental descriptor chosen for your Smells Like Victory ability equal to 1d4 per level you possess, plus your Key Offensive Modifier, and starts \n[Burning]\n. A successful Reflex save negates the \n[Burning]\n condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlash:\n Creatures in the spread are \n[Blinded]\n and \n[Deafened]\n for two \n[Rounds]\n. A successful Reflex save negates this effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTangle:\n Creatures in the spread are \n[Entangled]\n for two \n[Rounds]\n.

Once per \n[Encounter]\n, as a ranged attack, you can hurl a bomb that is beyond the wildest dreams of your stuffy professors at target square within \n[Close]\n range. You can make this attack as part of an attack action. The bomb detonates in a massive 60 ft radius spread originating from target square, inflicting 4 damage per level to all opponents in the vicinity. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Intelligence modifier) halves the damage. Additionally, the blast leaves a cloud of flaming debris throughout its area of effect that lasts three \n[Rounds]\n and deals 2 damage per character level you possess to any creature entering the debris cloud and to any creature that begins or ends its turn in the debris cloud.\n\n\nDefensive Track\n\n\nPick one of the following tracks. You gain the abilities of your chosen track in order, at the level shown in the table.\n\n\nAcrobatic Adept\n\n\nRogues who choose the Acrobatic Adept track rely on their athletic abilities to keep out of danger. Your Key Defensive Modifier is Constitution, as performing such an impressive series of dodges is incredibly draining.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Just That Quick \nEX\n\n\nYou learn to react to attacks with stunning alacrity, sometimes dodging a blow that would otherwise pierce your armor. Once per [Round] per circle you possess from this track, when an opponent who is not \n[Concealed]\n or \n[Fully concealed]\n makes an attack against you, if you are not \n[Entangled]\n, you may make a Reflex save and use the result in place of your AC against that attack if the result is higher than your AC.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Evasion \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, if you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an offensive action that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you may instead take no damage.\n\n\nAdditionally, you gain a bonus to Reflex saves equal to 1/4th your level (minimum 1).\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Supersonic Man \nEX\n\n\nYou gain a 10 ft bonus to your movement speed and a +1 bonus to AC, and you gain a \n[Bonus attack]\n whenever you take an attack action.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Don't Stop Me Now \nEX\n\n\nYou can slip out of any bonds, even magical ones, and dexterously dive over any obstacle. You gain \n[Immunity]\n to effects with the \n[Binding]\n descriptor, and moving out of a square of difficult terrain does not cost you extra movement.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Artful Dodger \nEX\n\n\nYour sweet moves have become things of beauty. You never provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 No Sell \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, any time during a \n[Round]\n, you may make a Reflex save.

Whenever you use Just that Quick and your opponent's attack roll misses, you gain 20% \n[Miss chance]\n for one \n[Round]\n. This stacks with itself, but not other sources, up to a maximum of 80% \n[Miss chance]\n.\n\n\nI Am Ten Ninjas\n\n\nPractioners of the exotic art of espionage known as ninjutsu often develop near-supernatural abilities to complement their stealth training. Your Key Defensive Modifier is Wisdom, as perceptiveness and self-control are critical in learning the art of the ninja.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Smoke Bomb! \nEX\n\n\nAs a ninja, you are well-schooled in the art of disappearing at a moment's notice. As a swift action, you can create an obscuring mist, as the spell. Creating a fourth obscuring mist causes the oldest of your obscuring mists to disperse immediately.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Ninja Reflexes \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, when you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an offensive action that would normally have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as a spell with a save of \"Reflex half\"), you may choose to instead ignore the effect entirely.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Shadow Step \nEX\n\n\nAs a swift action, you gain \n[Blindsight]\n out to \n[Melee]\n range and may add the \n[Teleport]\n descriptor to any of your movements for one \n[Round]\n.

Special vision modes like \n[Blindsight]\n, \n[Ghostwise sight]\n, and \n[Tremorsense]\n do not allow creatures to ignore the effects of the \n[Invisibility]\n condition on you. As a free action, you can turn this ability on or off. However, you must still use the Stealth skill to remain fully unseen.\n\n\nFortune's Friend\n\n\nSome people are just lucky. Whether by the blessings of some god, the accumulation of charms, or some innate ability to manipulate fate, things always seem to go more favorably for a very fortunate few. Your Key Defensive Modifier is Charisma, reflecting your ability to talk and finagle your way out of otherwise-deadly scrapes.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 A Little to the Left \nEX\n\n\nYou seem to narrowly dodge what would otherwise be lethal blows. Once per \n[Encounter]\n, if you would be reduced to negative hit points, you are instead reduced or healed to 1 hit point and immediately gain a move action. If you have the Swashbuckler track, this move action triggers the \nOnce More!\n ability (if you wish to use it).\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Improvisation \nEX\n\n\nAs a swift action, you can grant yourself or an ally within \n[Close]\n range a +2 bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Gift of Gab \nEX\n\n\nBy distracting your opponents with constant jokes, elaborate discourse, and simple nonsense, you gain a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +3 bonus to Reflex saving throws.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Better Lucky And Good \nEX\n\n\nTwice per \n[Encounter]\n, once per \n[Round]\n, you can remove any one of the following conditions from yourself: \n[Battered]\n, \n[Bleeding]\n, \n[Blinded]\n, \n[Confused]\n, \n[Cowering]\n, \n[Dazed]\n, \n[Dazzled]\n, \n[Deafened]\n, \n[Entangled]\n, \n[Exhausted]\n, \n[Fatigued]\n, \n[Frightened]\n, \n[Nauseated]\n, \n[Panicked]\n, \n[Paralyzed]\n, \n[Petrified]\n, \n[Shaken]\n, \n[Sickened]\n or \n[Stunned]\n. Activating this ability does not require an action, and can be done even if a condition would normally prevent you from acting.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Changing the Odds \nEX\n\n\nThings that shouldn't work in your favor sometimes do anyway. Once per \n[Scene]\n, plus an additional time for every Fortune's Friend circle you possess (including this one), as a swift action, you can reroll a single d20 roll you made after knowing whether that roll succeeds or fails. You must keep the second result, even if it's unfavorable.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Never Tell Me the Odds \nEX\n\n\nOnce per [Round], as an immediate action, you may add 1d4 to a single d20 roll you made after knowing the numerical result of the roll, and treat the sum as the new result of that roll. If the result of the two dice rolls together is 20 or higher, it counts as rolling a natural 20 in any situation in which a natural 20 would matter.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Roll With It \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, when you would take any amount of damage, you may take half that much damage instead.\n\n\nThe Gift\n\n\nEsoterica Radica\n\n\nSome rogues are by nature gamblers, people who bet everything on chances that they can't control. Whether a rogue is crouched in an alcove hoping a guard won't glance in while passing by or setting a fuse with just enough time to sprint through a hallway, dive through a window, and land in a moat, there is always an extra variable that no rogue can control. The abilities of the Esoterica Radica let you stretch your circumstances just far enough to get past that extra variable and make a quick getaway if you still can't win.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Playing it Right \nEX\n\n\nAny rogue learns to use a few key skills without pausing to think about them. Pick two skills. You can take 10 on both these skills regardless of circumstances.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 When to Hold \nEX\n\n\nWhen it's time to stand your ground, you trust in your uncanny luck to protect you. Once per \n[Encounter]\n per circle you possess in this track, as an immediate action, you may gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 When to Fold \nEX\n\n\nYou know the value of beating a hasty retreat in the face of danger. Once per \n[Encounter]\n, plus an additional usage for every 4 character levels, as a swift action, you can gain an extra move action on your current turn. If you use this move action to move, the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 When to Cheat \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, you may take an additional swift or immediate action.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 When to Run \nEX\n\n\nSometimes walking away from a fight isn't fast enough. Twice per \n[Encounter]\n, as an immediate action, you can move up to your movement speed.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 An Ace to Keep \nEX\n\n\nYou can be extra-lucky when you need to be. Once per \n[Round]\n, you may make a hit with an attack you made that is not a critical hit into a critical hit, inflicting all normal effects of a critical hit.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Gambler's Dao \nEX\n\n\nYou've made it this far with unbelievably good luck, so you may as well keep relying on it. Whenever you roll a d20, you instead roll two d20s and choose the better result.\n\n\nEsoterica Adeptus\n\n\nSome rogues are masters of their craft, experienced in such varied fields that they always have the expertise needed at a moment's notice. Whether it's a rogue adapting to broken tools to crack a safe as a guard approaches down the hall or having stowed a tool for just such an occasion, this rogue overcomes unforeseen circumstances through sheer versatility. The abilities of the Esoterica Adeptus let you broaden your master of the world enough for you account for that last-minute snag, or at least tilt the odds in your favor if things go sour.\n\n\nPath Feature \u2014 Tricks of the Trade\n\n\nChoose two skill trappings from any of the skills you are proficient in. The do not need to be from the same skill.

If you do, name your escape route and roll Acrobatics or Athletics versus a DC of 20 + the highest level of the enemies present.\n\n\nOn a success, you're gone. At the end of the \n[Round]\n, you appear in a location within \n[Medium]\n range that you declare as part of your escape. If your escape takes you someplace further, you can appear in that location within \n[Far]\n at the end of the next \n[Round]\n.  No creature can intercept or otherwise impede you \u2014 you effectively don't exist on the battlefield until you arrive at your location.\n\n\nIf you fail to meet the DC you can stay or go, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.  This can be damage, hangers on, a curse thrown at you as you flee, or anything else the table deems appropriate.\n\n\nAcrobatics\n\n\nEvasion\n\n\nYou can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects.\n\n\nWhen you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Reflex saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\n\n\nAdditionally, the first time each \n[Round]\n you must make a Reflex save you may instead roll Acrobatics.\n\n\nTumble\n\n\nYou gain advantage to disengage checks.

The number of allies you may assist this way is equal to your Athletics divided by 5.  You may round this number up.\n\n\n25 Ranks:\n Nothing restricts you from Taking 10 on Swim checks.\n\n\n\n\nLarceny\n\n\nKeymaster\n\n\nYou have been trained as a master locksmith and lockpicker.  To a true master like you, there is no lock that can't be opened. The measure for lock's quality is simply how long it takes.\n\n\nAfter you have failed the first check to open a specific lock, you can tell the DM you intend to put your head down and get the lock open \u2014 the DM then rolls a d6 to determine how long it takes you to open it. Usually that will be 1d6 minutes, but locks of extraordinary quality exist that take 1d6 hours or even 1d6 days. Rare locks like this protect the crown jewels of the Emperor or the Lich King's phylactery. Rumors persist of a legendary lock in the heart of Mechanus that would take even a master like you years if not centuries. It's not even about what the lock keeps safe.

These choices are permanent. This weapon, called your Grim Heritor, does not count against your normal limit of attuned magic items. When you gain your 4th circle in Just Blade, redesign this weapon as a Greater item, and when you gain your 6th circle, redesign it as a Relic.\n\n\nThough your Grim Heritor possesses the Arcane property, the weapon itself is a supernatural ability, and attacks with it benefit from magic weapon item bonuses to attack, magic item enchantments that trigger on a hit, and the Brutal property. While wielding your Grim Heritor, you count as having a Good Base Attack Bonus (equal to your level). You may only have a single Grim Heritor in existence at a time, and may cause it to disappear as a free action.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Mental Thrust\n\n\nAs a move action, you may cause target opponent within \n[Close]\n range to be \n[Blown away]\n in a direction of your choosing. If that opponent would enter and leave a square you occupy, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you before passing on its less than merry way. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates this effect.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Mystic Focus\n\n\nThe burgeoning power of your art allows you to create an unstable circuit of arcane power in your Grim Heritor. You begin each \n[Encounter]\n with your Grim Heritor uncharged. Once per \n[Roun]\nd, as a swift action, if your Grim Heritor is not already charged, you may choose a spell-like ability that you possess. If you do so, your Grim Heritor becomes charged.\n\n\nWhile your Grim Heritor is charged, you possess a 20% \n[Miss chance]\n.\n\n\nWhen you hit an opponent with an attack made using your Grim Heritor, if the Grim Heritor is charged, you may render it uncharged; note the result of your attack roll for that attack, and activate the chosen spell-like ability (if able) without provoking attacks of opportunity as a \n[Surge]\n effect. If the spell-like ability targets one or more creatures, you must choose that opponent as a target of the spell-like ability if able. If the spell-like ability targets one or more squares, you must choose one square that opponent occupies as a target of the spell-like ability if able.\n\n\nIf you would make an attack roll for an attack against a creature as part of activating the spell-like ability, compare the noted result to that creature\u2019s AC instead. If it equals or exceeds that creature\u2019s AC, that attack hits that creature. Abilities and effects other than the spell-like ability\u2019s effects that take place as the result of a hit or critical hit don\u2019t activate as a result of this hit.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Vectored Thrust\n\n\nYou gain the Fly movement mode.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Devastating Barrage\n\n\nYou can manipulate the latent forces of the universe. Once per \n[Round]\n, as a move action, you may create a line with a maximum length of 25 ft + 5 ft per four levels originating from you. Creatures occupying a square in the line are moved to the last square in the line.\n\n\nYou then create an implosion, dealing damage equal to twice your level to creatures other than you in that square or any square adjacent to that square, moving those creatures to that square, and knocking them \n[Prone]\n. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) halves the damage and negates the \n[Prone]\n condition and the moving effect from the implosion.\n\n\n6th Circle --Indestructible Focus\n\n\nYou gain \n[Lesser resistance]\n to all damage. At the beginning of your turn, you gain a Grim Barrier that grants \n[Lesser resistance]\n against the next source of damage you suffer. Grim Barriers accumulate during an \n[Encounter]\n and stack with one another, but each time you are dealt damage, a single Grim Barrier dissipates. All Grim Barriers dissipate at the end of each \n[Encounter]\n.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Voice of Devastation\n\n\nYou can call upon the fundamental truths of the universe and proclaim your enemies\u2019 mortality. Once per \n[Encounter]\n, as a swift action, you may create a spread with a radius equal to your \n[Close]\n range originating from you that deals damage equal to three times your level to all opponents and renders them \n[Battered]\n for 3 \n[Rounds]\n and \n[Stunned]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n. A successful Will save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates the \n[Stunned]\n condition.\n\n\nArcane Lore\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Black Tidings\n\n\nOnce per \n[Round]\n, as a standard action, you toss twisting gyres of energy through the air, dealing devastating damage. The actual blast wave takes one of the four following forms, which you may freely alternate between.\n\n\nDread Wave\n\n\nThe Dread Wave manifests as a wedge with a length of 20 ft + 10 ft per circle of Arcane Lore you possess originating from you that deals energy damage with the \n[Cold]\n descriptor or magical damage with the \n[Negative]\n descriptor, chosen each time you activate Dread Wave. The Dread Wave deals damage equal to your KOM plus 1d4 per character level you possess to all creatures in the wedge and renders them \n[Shaken]\n for one \n[Round]\n. A successful Will save (DC 10 + \u00bd character level + Key Offensive Modifier) negates the \n[Shaken]\n condition.\n\n\nHammerfall\n\n\nHammerfall deals 1d6 energy damage with the \n[Fire]\n descriptor or physical damage, chosen each time you activate Hammerfall, per character level you possess to each creature in a target square within 100 ft plus 15 ft per character level or any square within one square of that square. \n\n\nAt 3rd circle, this increases to within two squares of that square. At 5th circle, this increases to within three squares of that square. At 7th circle, this increases to within four squares of that square at 7th circle.\n\n\nA successful Reflex save (DC 10 + \u00bd character level + Key Offensive Modifier) halves the damage.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Canto\n\n\nSelect one of the two following abilities. This choice is permanent..\n\n\nRed Hymn\n\n\nFor every five points of damage dealt to an opponent by your Black Tidings, an ally of your choice within 100 ft is healed for 2 HP.\n\n\nGrey Hymn\n\n\nFor every ten points of damage dealt by your Black Tidings to an opponent, any ally besides yourself of your choice within 100 ft may move 5 ft. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 With A Word\n\n\nWhenever you use your Black Tidings ability, immediately after using it, you may Teleport up to 15 ft in any direction.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Verso\n\n\nSometimes the few must suffer in the name of your own personal and completely opaque agenda. Whenever you use Black Tidings, select one opponent who failed the associated save. This opponent is \n[Battered]\n for one \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Recto\n\n\nRecto improves the ability you selected as your canto. The following text replaces your Red Hymn or Grey Hymn respectively:\n\n\nCrimson Hymn\n\n\nFor every four points of damage dealt by your Black Tidings, an ally within 100 ft of your choice is healed for 2 hit points.\n\n\nSilver Hymn\n\n\nFor every ten points of damage dealt by your Black Tidings, any ally besides yourself of your choice within 100 ft may move 10 ft. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Bitter News\n\n\nOnce every two \n[Rounds]\n, immediately after dealing damage with Black Tidings, you may inflict HP reduction equal to the damage dealt on each affected creature to each affected creature.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Binding\n\n\nSelect one of the two following abilities. This choice is permanent.\n\n\nGlimpse of Madness\n\n\nAny creature affected by your Black Tidings who fails the associated save is Blinded for two \n[Rounds]\n.\n\n\nLife Fades\n\n\nAny creature affected by your Black Tidings who fails the associated save is Exhausted for the rest of the \n[Encounter]\n. This ability does not work if the target has Immunity to Negative.\n\n\nOther tracks\n\n\nForce Of Will\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Healing Burst\n\n\nBy focusing for a moment on the mechanisms of creation, you can force a bit of life back into the world. As a move action, you may create a 15 ft radius spread originating from you, healing 1 HP per character level plus your Key Defensive Modifier to all allies within the spread. This is not a Positive or Negative effect and can only be used once per \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 A Stitch In Time\n\n\nTime is fleeting, but you have learned how to warp it for just a second, long enough perhaps to change fate. As a standard action, you may create a 15 ft radius spread originating from you, which affects a single ally within the area, plus an additional ally within the area for every circle you possess in this track. Those affected may immediately make a single melee or ranged attack. A creature may only be affected by A Stitch in Time once per \n[Round]\n.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Stem The Tide\n\n\nTwice per \n[Encounter]\n as an immediate action, you may craft a shimmering rune of force, then bestow it on a single ally within 45 ft. You start any \n[Encounter]\n with one rune placed, and may have up to two placed at any given time. This rune serves to block half the damage that would be dealt against that ally by a single source, and then dissipates in a shudder of smoke. This effect stacks in such a way that someone with two active runes protecting them takes no damage from a single source, but cannot opt to split them across two sources of damage.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Steady Old Hand\n\n\nYou may use A Stitch In Time as a standard action or as a swift action, and the radius of its spread is increased to 25 ft.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Shields, Brace!\n\n\nWhenever an opponent sets off a rune from the Stem the Tide ability, that opponent provokes an attack of opportunity. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates this effect.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Swift As Thought\n\n\nWhenever you activate A Stitch in Time, you may also activate Healing Burst at the same time without taking another action. Healing Burst can now be activated any number of times per \n[Roun]\nd.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 The Time Is Now\n\n\nThe clock is but an illusion. Once per \n[Round]\n, you may place the protective rune from your Stem the Tide ability upon yourself in response to taking damage after learning how much damage you would take. This does not count against Stem the Tide\u2019s \n[Encounter]\n limits.\n\n\nArcane Secrets\n\n\nYou gain the ability to manifest a particular flavor of spell-like abilities called Arcane Secrets, which are usable at will.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Hungry Shadows\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may create a 15 ft radius spread originating from target square within \n[Medium]\n range, dealing damage equal to your KOM and inflicting a -1 penalty to attack rolls and and Reflex and Fortitude saves to all opponents in the spread and halving the movement speed of each of those opponents for 2 \n[Rounds]\n. This is an Evocation effect.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Space, Discontent\n\n\nYou gain your choice of the Lungbreaker or Stutter Step Arcane Secret (this choice is permanent).\n\n\nLungbreaker\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may create one 5 ft radius spread originating from target square within \n[Close]\n range for every 4 levels you possess (minimum one). Each spread lasts for 4 \n[Rounds]\n. Creatures on opposite sides of a spread lose line of effect to each other and are \n[Concealed]\n in respect to one another. Creatures within a spread are \n[Concealed]\n to creatures outside of it, and vice versa. \n\n\nWhenever a creature besides yourself begins its turn inside a spread or the first time each \n[Round]\n that a creature besides yourself enters a spread, it becomes Nauseated for one \n[Round]\n. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates the Nauseated condition. This is a Creation effect.\n\n\nStutter Step\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may create a 30 ft radius spread originating from target square within \n[Close]\n range, inflicting the \n[Slowed]\n condition for 1 \n[Round]\n per 5 levels you possess (minimum one \n[Round]\n) on all creatures besides yourself in the area. A successful Will save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates the \n[Slowed]\n condition. This is a Binding Evocation effect.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Dweomertide\n\n\nYou gain access to two Arcane Secrets, Spellbreaker and Reweave.\n\n\nSpellbreaker\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may end a single target effect created by a spell or spell-like ability of a circle lower than your highest Arcane Secrets circle that has a duration and that originates from a creature or square within \n[Medium]\n range or targeted a creature within \n[Medium]\n range. This is a Dispelling effect.\n\n\nReweave\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may restore one effect ended by a Dispelling effect in the last two \n[Rounds]\n that affected a creature or object within \n[Medium]\n range.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Space, Twisted\n\n\nYou gain access to the following Arcane Secrets:\n\n\nRevelation\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may create a spread with a radius of 5 ft per circle of this track you possess originating from target square within \n[Close]\n range. This spread lasts for 2 \n[Rounds]\n. While they are within the spread, creatures are Revealed, and if they are Invisible, they are treated as not being Invisible. This is a Divination effect.\n\n\nDark Tendrils\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may use Wall of Thorns, as the spell.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Unbearable Lightness Of Casting\n\n\nYou may activate any Arcane Secret you know as a swift action.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Gravity Smash\n\n\nYou are able to summon the strength of the earth itself. As a standard action, you may create a 15 ft radius spread originating from target square within \n[Close]\n range, which lasts for 2 \n[Rounds]\n. While in the spread, creatures suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and all physical skill checks. Whenever a creature in the spread spends an action to cast a spell, if that creature has not made a save against an ability named Gravity Smash since spending that action, that spell has no effect. \n\n\nA successful Will save (DC 10 + \u00bd your level + your KOM) negates this effect. Each \n[Round]\n, at the end of your turn, Gravity Smash deals 35 damage to each creature in the spread. This is a Binding Transmutation effect.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Cascade Failure\n\n\nFor each different Arcane Secret you\u2019ve activated during this \n[Encounter]\n, the save DCs of all your Arcane Secrets increases by +1, to a maximum of +4. For each different Arcane Secret you\u2019ve chosen when activating the Mystic Focus ability during this \n[Encounter]\n, your Grim Heritor gains a +1 bonus to hit while it is charged with an Arcane Secret, to a maximum of +4.",

For this reason, shamans get along very well with other people, always eager to gain new insights from them.\n\n\nParty Role\n\n\nAs a spellcaster, a shaman can tear the enemy asunder with powerful offensive magic, but the class also provides a large number of defensive and healing abilities that any party will appreciate.

You heal HP or deal damage equal to 2d4 plus your Key Offensive modifier. Tis amount increases by 1d4 for each character level beyond 1st; for example, you heal HP or deal damage equal to 21d4 + your KOM at level 20.\n\n\nDealing damage to an opponent with\nyour Incantation requires a successful ranged attack roll (this is not considered an attack with a weapon); healing an ally does not require an attack roll.\n\n\nAdditionally, whenever you decide to use your Incantation, you count as having a Good Base\nAttack Bonus (equal to your character level) until the beginning of your next turn. Tis applies to any attack rolls you make as part of that Incantation.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Imbue Spell \nSLA\n\n\nAs a swift action, you may spend a spell slot of any circle. If you do, choose a spell you know of that circle or lower which either has a Target listing of a single creature or has a listed Incantation version (if a spell fts both criteria, you must choose the Incantation version).\n\n\nWhen you hit an opponent with an Incantation or heal an ally with an Incantation this [Round], if the chosen spell is not discharged from your Incantation, you may note the result of your attack roll for your Incantation attack (if you attacked with your Incantation), and cast the chosen spell without provoking attacks of opportunity and without offering a save as a [Surge] effect. If you do, that spell is discharged from your Incantation.\n\n\nYou must choose that opponent or ally as the target of the spell. If you would make an attack roll for an attack against a creature as part of casting the spell, compare the noted result to that creature\u2019s AC instead. If it equals or exceeds that creature\u2019s AC, that attack hits that creature. Abilities and effects other than the spell\u2019s effects that take place as the result of a hit or critical hit don\u2019t activate as a result of this hit.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Shaman\u2019s Presence \nSU\n\n\nAllies within 30ft of you have [Fast healing] equal to your KDM.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Guardian Spirits \nSU\n\n\nOnce per [Scene] after making a d20 roll and seeing the result, you may reroll it as an immediate action, taking the better of the two results.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Shallow Grave \nSU\n\n\nOnce per [Scene], as an immediate action, you can prevent an ally within [Close] range from dying for 1 [Round]. The ally ignores the [Dying], [Unconscious] and [Stable] conditions and has [Immunity] to the [Dead] condition for the duration of Shallow Grave, but unless the ally receives sufficient healing to raise their hit points above what would kill them, it immediately dies at the end of your turn after the effect expires. At 20th level, you can activate this ability once per [Encounter].\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Twin Incantation \nSLA\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], as a standard action, you may activate the Incantation ability twice. You may activate the Imbue Spell ability without taking an action immediately before the second Incantation is activated; the spell that may be cast as a result is not a [Surge] effect.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Stolen Moment \nSU\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], you may immediately activate your healing Incantation upon an ally that has just been dealt damage or afflicted with a harmful condition or effect. Tis does not require an action. You may activate the Imbue Spell ability as an immediate action before activating the Incantation ability in this way; the spell must be cast and discharged.\n\n\nShaman\u2019s Path\n\n\nShamans are a diverse lot, ranging from humble servants of nature to raving battle priests. Each shaman picks a track that fits them best, and gains a unique source of power in the process.\n\n\nPick an ability track, excluding class-locked tracks such as the paladin\u2019s Judgment or the rogue\u2019s Esoterica Radica. This track must not have special requirements that you do not fulfill. That track replaces the Shaman\u2019s Path track for you.\n\n\nIf any circles from the chosen track would use ability score modifiers other than your KDM or\nyour KOM to calculate an effect, you may choose to have them use your Wisdom modifier instead.\nYou can\u2019t multiclass into or out of this track.\n\n\nSpellcasting\n\n\nYou cast spells drawn from the shaman spell list, detailed in Section XII. Your Wisdom modifier is your Spellcasting Ability modifier (SAM) for this track. The DC for your spells is equal to \n10 + \u00bd level + SAM\n. You can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level in a [Scene]. That number is noted on the \u201cSpells per [Scene] by Circle\u201d table below. You also receive bonus spells per [Scene] for having a high Spellcasting Ability Modifier.\n\n\nYou can only cast spells that you know. You gain an additional three spells known every time you gain a circle in this track. Any time that you level up, you can unlearn a single spell and learn a new spell of the same level. You cannot learn spells of a level you cannot cast. You may use an available spell slot of a circle to cast any spell you know of that circle or lower.\n\n\nSpells per [Scene] by Circle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nSpell Circle\n\n\n1st\n\n\n2nd\n\n\n3rd\n\n\n4th\n\n\n5th\n\n\n6th\n\n\n7th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n7\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n3",

Tacticians rarely hold their own in a duel, but their talents lie elsewhere \u2014 in finding the enemy's weak point and enabling their allies to strike it as effectively as possible. To this end, tacticians train in a diverse range of skills, from powerful magic that can turn the tide of a battle to unorthodox tactics that give them and their allies an edge in combat.\n\n\nParty Role\n\n\nA tactician is a support character. While he may not be personally swinging a sword, his abilities greatly help the party's front-liners. Tacticians win fights through careful application of the right spell in the right place, an art much subtler than beating things to death with sticks.\n\n\nTacticians in Your Game\n\n\nTacticians can be used in many leadership roles: as army officers, bandit chiefs or rebellion leaders. Their focus on magic and knowledge makes them ideal wizards or scholars. Because they are spellcasters, some uninformed people may confuse them for shamans.\n\n\nAttack and Save Progression\n\n\nTacticians have a Poor Base Attack bonus.

As a result, you and your allies are well prepared for nearly any fight you face.\n\n\nAs part of a move action, you can attempt a Knowledge skill check of the relevant type against your opponent (Arcana against an \n[Outsider]\n, for example). If there are several opponents of the same creature type, the ability affects all of them; opponents with different creature types require additional skill checks (requiring additional partial move actions).\n\n\n\n\nThe DC of the check is equal to 10 + the level of the highest-level opponent of that creature type (minimum 11).\n\n\nIf you succeed on the check, you and allies who can establish line of sight to you or receive your communication gain the benefits of one of the abilities that you know from the list below.\n\n\nYou can make any number of Knowledge checks in this way per \n[Encounter]\n as long as you spend an action for each, but you cannot apply the same ability to the same creature type more than once during the \n[Encounter]\n.\n\n\nOpponents that join an \n[Encounter]\n in progress are affected by any Knowledge skill checks that were made for these abilities this \n[Encounter]\n that have affected opponents of their creature type. \n\n\n\n\nThe effects of a Tactical Insight ability expire at the end of the \n[Encounter]\n, with new Knowledge checks necessary the next time you encounter that opponent.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Combative Precognition \nEX\n\n\nYou and your allies may gain either a +3 bonus to attack rolls or a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class against opponents affected by your Knowledge check. You choose which bonus to apply when activating your Tactical Insight ability. When you gain the 3rd circle of this track, you no longer have to choose: you gain both benefits of Combative Precognition whenever you activate it.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Psychological Warfare \nEX\n\n\nYou and your allies may gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perception checks against opponents affected by your Knowledge check.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Precognitive Resistance \nEX\n\n\nYou and your allies may gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against effects used or abilities activated by opponents affected by your Knowledge check.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 Exploit Weakness \nEX\n\n\nYou and your allies may gain a +2 bonus to the DC of any abilities you or they activate against opponents affected by your Knowledge check.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Advanced Insights \nEX\n\n\nPick one of the following abilities. This choice is permanent:\n\n\n\n\nQuick Insight:\n You can activate your Tactical Insight ability as a swift action.\n\n\nDeep Insight:\n Choose one of your Tactical Insight circles other than this one. You increase the bonus granted by that circle by 1.\n\n\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Countermeasures \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, as an immediate action, you may automatically cancel a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that an opponent affected by your Knowledge check attempts to activate. The ability automatically fails. The ability counts as having been activated for the purpose of any resource cost (such as spell slots), and if an action was spent for the ability, the action counts as having been used.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Unspeakable Secret \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, as a swift action, you may divulge a secret so profound that it renders a single opponent affected by your Knowledge check \n[Stunned]\n for one \n[Round]\n. There is no save allowed, and if the opponent has \n[Immunity]\n to being \n[Stunned]\n the opponent is \n[Dazed]\n instead. If the opponent has \n[Immunity]\n to both, the ability has no effect, but you really should have known about its \n[Immunity]\n beforehand.\n\n\nBag of Tricks\n\n\n1st Circle \u2014 Surgical Precision \nEX\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n per circle of Bag of Tricks you possess, as a swift action, when you create a spread, line, or wedge without a duration, you may remove any number of squares from the area of the effect or rearrange them so long as each square in the area of the effect is adjacent to at least one other square in the area of the effect. Each square must be within range of the square or creature from which the spread, line, or wedge originates if the effect has a range, or within a distance from the square or creature from which the spread, line, or wedge originates equal to its length or radius if it does not.\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2014 Early Warning \nEX\n\n\nYou and all allies within 30 ft gain a bonus to initiative checks equal to 1/4 your level (minimum 1).\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2014 Bait and Switch \nSU\n\n\nOnce per 4 levels per \n[Encounter]\n as a move action, if you have line of sight to two allies who are each within 10 ft per your character level of your location, you can switch the positions of those two allies. You can use this ability to switch yourself with another ally.\n\n\nThis is a \n[Warp]\n effect.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2014 The Enemy You Know \nSU\n\n\nYou have \n[Resistance]\n to energy and magic damage.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2014 Dweomerbreaker \nSU\n\n\nOnce per [Encounter], as a standard action, you may empower the attacks of allies within 30 ft until the beginning of your next turn. The first time each ally under this effect hits an opponent with an attack, they may end a single target effect created by a spell or spell-like ability that has a duration and that originates from the opponent or targeted the opponent. This is a \n[Dispelling]\n effect.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2014 Saw That Coming \nSU\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, as an immediate action, you can negate an offensive action that targets you specifically. This includes targeted spells, abilities, or attacks, but not area effects. The offensive action still counts as having been activated for the purpose of any resource cost (such as spell slots), and if an action was spent for the offensive action, that action counts as having been used.\n\n\n7th Circle \u2014 Checkmate \nSU\n\n\nOnce per \n[Encounter]\n, as a standard action, you can imprison an opponent within your \n[Close]\n range for the next 2 \n[Rounds]\n. The opponent is incapable of acting or perceiving its surroundings, but it gains \n[Immunity]\n to damage and \n[HP reduction]\n, it cannot be targeted by an attack or ability, and line of effect is blocked between the creature and any attack, ability, or effect. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates this effect, but leaves your target \n[Dazed]\n for 1 \n[Round]\n.\n\n\nThe Playbook\n\n\nYou cast spells drawn from the tactician spell list. Your Intelligence modifier is your Spellcasting Ability Modifier (SAM) for this track. The DC for your spells is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Spellcasting Ability Modifier. You can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level in a [Scene], as noted in the table below. You also receive bonus spells per [Scene] for having a high Spellcasting Ability Modifier.\n\n\nYou can only cast spells that you know.

            "text": "Combat Alchemist\n\n\nAlchemy is an ancient and noble art dedicated to revealing the underpinnings of the universe itself. You can also use it to transmute living things into corpses by throwing deadly chemicals in their face.\n\n\nWhen you select this track, choose your highest Spellcasting Ability Modifer (SAM), or if you do not have a SAM, your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifer. This becomes your Track Ability Modifer (TAM) for this track. The save DC for abilities under this track is equal to \n10 + \u00bd level + TAM\n.\n\n\n1st Circle \u2013 Lesser Brewing \nEX\n\n\nYou have the ability to create Brews: potent but short-lived magical concoctions. These concoctions come in three varieties: potions for drinking, poisons that are applied to weapons, and cocktails for throwing into battle. At the beginning of each [Scene], you choose three Brews, plus an additional two Brews for each circle of Combat Alchemist you possess. The chosen Brews are prepared until the end of the [Scene]. At first, you can prepare only Lesser Brews, but you learn to prepare other brews at later circles.\n\n\nPrepared Brews must be primed before they can be used. You can prime a prepared Brew for imminent use as a move action. Once a Brew is primed, any creature can use it: a creature can drink a potion to gain its benefit, apply a poison to its weapon to increase its potency, or pass any Brew to an ally within [Melee] range as part of a move action (including the one used to prime it). A primed Brew not used by the end of the [Encounter] is wasted. A creature or weapon, respectively, may benefit from more than one potion or poison at a time but cannot benefit from multiple uses of the same potion or poison simultaneously. A poison that has an effect when a creature is hit by the affected weapon and allows that creature to make a saving throw cannot affect a single creature more than once per [Round].\n\n\nWhenever you make an attack action, you may replace any number of attacks with an equal number of cocktail throws, each targeting a square within [Close] range. These throws provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the effects of any Brew used last until the end of the [Encounter].\n\n\n2nd Circle \u2013 Transform \nSU\n\n\nYour knowledge of esoteric sciences includes the nature of things as well as the supernature of things. You begin each [Encounter] with a number of transmutation points equal to the number of Combat Alchemist circles you possess. Additionally, you gain the following abilities:\n\n\nExclusion Principle\n\n\nAs an immediate action, when an ally within [Long] range uses a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability with an area of effect, you may spend one transmutation point to exclude any number of creatures from the effect.\n\n\nConservation of Energy\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may spend one transmutation point to deal damage equal to 1d10 per circle of Combat Alchemist you possess to one creature within [Medium] range and heal another creature within [Medium] range a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect.\n\n\nAssisted Entanglement\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may spend one transmutation point to have two target creatures within [Close] range simultaneously [Teleport] into each other\u2019s squares. The destination squares may be occupied, but only by another target of this ability, and only if both targets leave their squares as part of this ability. A successful Reflex save negates this ability.\n\n\n3rd Circle \u2013 Greater Brewing \nEX\n\n\nYou can now prepare Greater Brews in addition to Lesser Brews.\n\n\n4th Circle \u2013 Relic Brewing \nEX\n\n\nYou can now prepare Relic Brews in addition to Lesser Brews and Greater Brews.\n\n\n5th Circle \u2013 Transmute \nSU\n\n\nYour mastery of arcane structures continues to grow. You gain the following abilities:\n\n\nEquivalent Exchange\n\n\nAs an immediate action, when an offensive action originating from a creature within your [Medium] range, or whose target is within your [Medium] range, would deal energy damage with the [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire] descriptors, you may spend two transmutation points to have that damage lose those descriptors and gain the [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire] descriptor instead.\n\n\nNonlocality\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may spend two transmutation points to move the area of any ongoing area-affecting spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability within [Close] range to any other location within [Close] range to which you have line of sight and line of effect. The effect\u2019s creator may make a Will save. A successful Will save negates this ability. You cannot move an ongoing area effect originating from a creature.\n\n\nPhilosopher\u2019s Stone\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may spend two transmutation points to transmute the equipment of target creature in [Close] range to heavy and largely useless gold. The target is [Slowed], the target\u2019s item bonus to AC from armor is halved, the target\u2019s deflection bonus to AC from a shield is halved, and if the target is wielding a weapon other than a natural weapon, that weapon loses two weapon properties of the target\u2019s choice and the target takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls made using that weapon. These effects last until the end of the [Encounter]. The target may make a Fortitude save, a Reflex save, and a Will save. A successful Fortitude save prevents the target\u2019s item bonus to AC from armor from being halved. A successful Reflex save prevents the target\u2019s deflection bonus to AC from a shield from being halved. A successful Will save negates the loss of weapon properties and the penalty to attack rolls.\n\n\n6th Circle \u2013 Artifact Brewing \nEX\n\n\nYou can now prepare Artifact Brews in addition to Lesser, Greater and Relic Brews. When an artifact poison or potion is applied to a creature or weapon, the duration of any artifact poison or potion already affecting the same target ends. Afer a creature fails its save against a particular artifact poison, it can\u2019t be affected by that poison again until the end of the [Encounter].\n\n\n7th Circle \u2013 Transcend \nSU\n\n\nYour mastery of the esoteric is absolute. You gain the following abilities:\n\n\nMomentum Transfer\n\n\nAs an immediate action, you may spend four transmutation points to cause a creature within [Long] range to be unable to take standard actions for 1 [Round]. A successful Will save negates this effect. If you cause a creature using an ability that requires a standard action to use  to be unable to take standard actions, that creature does not use that ability or expend any uses of that ability.\n\n\nNecromuscular Stimulation\n\n\nWhen you die, if you have a Lifewine Brew prepared but not primed, you may spend four transmutation points to cause the Lifewine Brew to boil over into a revivifying gas. If you do so, the Lifewine is consumed, and you are reborn in a bolt of alchemical glory on your next turn with current hit points equal to half of your maximum hit points. Neuromuscular Stimulation can only be used once per [Scene].\n\n\nCarbonization\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may spend four transmutation points to inflict a flesh-hardening curse on a single creature in [Close] range. The creature is [Entangled]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Entangled] condition. Each subsequent [Round], at the beginning of your turn, the creature makes an additional Fortitude save, the effects of which vary depending on its current state, as listed below:\n\n\n\n\nNot [Entangled] or [Slowed]\n: The creature becomes [Entangled]. A successful save negates the [Entangled] condition and ends the Carbonization ability.\n\n\n[Entangled]\n: The creature becomes [Slowed]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Slowed] condition, and removes the [Entangled] condition if it was caused by Carbonization.\n\n\n[Slowed]\n: The creature becomes [Entangled]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Entangled] condition, and removes the [Slowed] condition if it was caused by Carbonization.\n\n\nBoth [Entangled] and [Slowed]\n: The creature becomes [Petrified] for three [Rounds]. While the affected creature is [Petrified], it does not make saves against Carbonization. It still makes saves against the [Petrified] condition normally. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Petrified] condition, and removes the [Slowed] condition if it was caused by Carbonization.\n\n\n\n\nThis effect, and all conditions inflicted by it, end either once the target creature has been [Petrified] by it for 3 [Rounds], or at the end of the [Encounter].\n\n\nProbability Redistribution\n\n\nAs a standard action, you may choose two creatures, causing an exchange of one condition or temporary magical effects from each to the other. Viable effects include spells and spell-like ability targeting that creature with a duration measured in [Rounds], an [Encounter] or a [Scene], and the following conditions:\n[Battered], [Bleeding], [Blinded], [Confused], [Cowering], [Dazed], [Dazzled], [Deafened], [Entangled], [Exhausted], [Fatigued], [Frightened], [Nauseated], [Panicked], [Paralyzed], [Petrified], [Shaken], [Sickened] or [Stunned]. If only one of your targets is under a valid effect, you only move a single valid effect from that target to the other target. Both targets must be within [Medium] range, and each can make a Will save to negate this effect. If either succeeds, Probability Redistribution fails entirely.\n\n\nCombat Alchemist Brews\n\n\nLesser Potions\n\n\nBlack Teardrop:\n This potion grants you [Darkvision] when you drink it.\n\n\nIronblood Draught:\n This potion increases the save DCs of any one of your spell-like or supernatural abilities, or one spellcasting track, by +2 when you drink it.\n\n\nLiquid Courage:\n This potion grants you an item bonus to attack rolls and saves against [Fear] effects equal to the number of circles of Combat Alchemist possessed by the creature who primed it.\n\n\nPerformance Enhancer:\n This potion grants you temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your level when you drink it.\n\n\nLesser Poisons\n\n\nRainbow Droplet:\n When you prime this potion, choose [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire]. Whenever an attack with a weapon affected by this poison deals damage, that attack deals 1d6 additional energy damage with the chosen descriptor per odd-numbered circle of Combat Alchemist you possess.\n\n\nFirewater:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Burning] condition.\n\n\nMidas Touch:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Dazzled] condition for 2 [Round].\n\n\nOverdose:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Sickened] condition for 1 [Round]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Sickened] condition.\n\n\nPixie Dust:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Revealed] condition for 3 [Rounds]. A successful Reflex save negates the [Revealed]\ncondition.\n\n\nLesser Cocktails\n\n\nHazy Blur:\n As the spell obscuring mist.\n\n\nPainter\u2019s Comfort:\n When you prime this cocktail, choose [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire]. This cocktail creates a 20ft radius spread of elemental energy that originates from target square. Whenever a creature moves into or begins its turn in this spread, it is dealt energy damage with the chosen descriptor equal to your level. A creature can only be dealt damage from a given Painter\u2019s Comfort cocktail once per [Round].\n\n\nGreater Potions\n\n\nElemental Port:\n When you prime this potion, choose [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire]. This potion grants you [Lesser resistance] to that energy type when you drink it. At 4th Circle, this improves to [Resistance], and at 6th Circle, it improves to [Greater resistance].\n\n\nQuinhora Nervi:\n When you brew this potion, choose either Reflex saves or Fortitude and Will saves. This potion grants you the ability to entirely ignore an effect that would have a reduced effect on a successful save of the chosen type once per [Encounter] when you drink it. You can prime Quinhora Nervi as an immediate action, and any creature can drink it or pass it to another creature as part of an immediate action.\n\n\nGreater Poisons\n\n\nDoomshine:\n When you prime this poison, choose [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire]. Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict [Vulnerability] to that energy type for 1 [Round]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Vulnerability].\n\n\nThe Shakes:\n Whenever you hit an opponent with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, if it is the first time you have hit that opponent with an attack using this weapon this [Round], you may inflict the [Shaken] condition for 2 [Rounds]. A successful Will save negates the [Shaken] condition.\n\n\nHypersensitivity:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict a -2 penalty to the target\u2019s saves for 1 [Round].\n\n\nGreater Cocktails\n\n\nCavorite Serum:\n This cocktail unleashes an explosion of luminescent shrapnel that creates a 30ft radius spread originating from target square. Creatures caught in this spread gain [Flying] and\nthe Fly movement mode.\n\n\nFormula 624:\n This cocktail creates a 50ft radius spread originating from target square. Each opponent within the area is dealt damage equal to the highest Combat Alchemist circle you possess each time it is affected by any spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability.\n\n\nRelic Potions\n\n\nTaurus Cardinalis:\n This potion grants you the Fly movement mode when you drink it. Unlike most Brews, this effect lasts for the remainder of the [Scene].\n\n\nHypotonic Sap:\n This potion grants you the Swim movement mode when you drink it. Unlike most Brews, this effect lasts for the remainder of the [Scene].\n\n\nDisappearing Drought:\n This potion makes you [Invisible] for 2 [Rounds] when you drink it.\n\n\nRelic Poisons\n\n\nBlack Blood:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Battered] condition for 1 [Round]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Battered]\ncondition.\n\n\nDoublevision:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Nauseated] condition for 1 [Round]. A successful Reflex save negates the [Nauseated] condition. A creature that fails this save can\u2019t be affected by a Doublevision poison again for the rest of the [Encounter].\n\n\nBad Trip:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Frightened] condition for 1 [Round]. A successful Reflex save negates the [Frightened]\ncondition. A creature that fails this save can\u2019t be affected by a Bad Trip poison again for the rest of the [Encounter].\n\n\nRelic Cocktails\n\n\nWell Aged:\n The cocktail creates a swirling spread of raw potential energy with a radius of 5ft + 5ft per 5 levels you possess originating from target square. Abilities, conditions and effects within that radius that have their durations measured in [Rounds] have those durations increased by 1 [Round]. (This increases the duration of any effect whose space includes one or more squares within this radius.)This does not affect the [Dazed], [Stunned], [Paralyzed], or [Petrified] conditions.\n\n\nArtifact Potions\n\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu:\n This potion grants you another use of any one ability that can only be used a limited number of times per [Scene], or one additional spell slot of any circle when you drink it. If the ability was originally usable only once per [Scene], it can now be used twice per [Scene], but cannot be used more than once per [Encounter]. Any one ability or spell circle can only benefit from a D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu potion once per [Scene].\n\n\nArtifact Poisons\n\n\nKnockout Juice:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Dazed] condition for 1 [Round]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Dazed]\ncondition.\n\n\nLiquid Therror:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Panicked] condition for 1 [Round]. A successful Will save negates the [Panicked]\ncondition.\n\n\nZopiclone:\n Whenever you hit with an attack using a weapon affected by this poison, you may inflict the [Confused] condition for 2 [Rounds]. A successful Reflex save negates the [Confused]\ncondition.\n\n\nArtifact Cocktails\n\n\nLifewine:\n This cocktail revives a single [Dead] or [Unconscious] creature in the affected square with current hit points equal to half of its maximum hit points. A given creature can only be affected by a Lifewine cocktail once per [Scene].",

For purposes of dealing with environmental hazards, one Acrobatics check should generally be enough unless something happens to increase the difficulty of that check; for purposes of combat, one check should generally be needed for each [Round] in which you attempt to use a function of the Acrobatics skill.\n\n\nMoving Through Threatened Areas\n\n\nIf you wish to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity from moving through a creature\u2019s threatened area, you may make an Acrobatics check (DC equal to 10 + your opponent\u2019s BAB + your opponent\u2019s KOM) when you enter its threatened area. This DC is increased by 10 for areas within that opponent\u2019s occupied square(s). Success means you do not provoke an attack of opportunity; failure means you provoke an attack of opportunity but can still move normally (aside from any consequences of the attack).\n\n\nMoving Through Occupied Squares\n\n\nAs part of a move action, you may make an Acrobatics check (DC equal to 15 + your opponent\u2019s BAB + your opponent\u2019s KOM) to enter a square occupied by an opponent who can target you with melee attacks. This does not allow you to end movement in that square.\n\n\nSurprising an Opponent\n\n\nAs part of a move action, you can make an Acrobatics check with a DC equal to the Armor Class of an opponent within [Long] range (as per normal partial move actions, if you move with your move action, you halve your movement speed for that movement). If you succeed, your opponent loses track of you and is [Flat-footed] against any attacks you make on your turn. If you attempted to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity as part of the same move action, don\u2019t make two Acrobatics checks \u2013 compare the same check to each DC and determine the results separately.\n\n\nBalancing\n\n\nIf you would suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, you may make a Balance check instead, with a DC chosen by the GM that corresponds to a surface or object that you can use to keep from falling. If you succeed, you do not suffer that fall. Instead, you become able to stand on the surface or object as if on solid ground until you suffer another Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge (you do not lose the [Flying] condition from this). A few representative objects, with appropriate DCs, follow:\n\n \nDC 15:\n Slick floor in a grocery store. The kind that require signs so people don\u2019t slip and hurt themselves. Alternatively, an oil slick on a road.\n\n \nDC 20:\n Icy rock. \n\n \nDC 25:\n Rain-slick precipice of darkness, or an inch-thick tree branch.\n\n \nDC 30:\n The point of a spear (obviously, without being impaled). This cannot get you un-stabbed if someone successfully attacks you.\n\n \nDC 35:\n The grains of sand in a desert storm.\n\n \nDC 40:\n Clouds.\n\n\nJumping\n\n\nOnce per [Round], you may make an Acrobatics skill check to jump over an obstacle or jump high into the air.\n\n \nDC 15:\n Cross a fast stream without getting your boots wet.\n\n \nDC 20:\n Jump from one roof to another, with a narrow alley separating them.\n\n \nDC 25:\n Jump from one roof to another, across a street. Alternatively, vault an ogre-proof fence.\n\n \nDC 30:\n Leap onto the back of a charging war elephant. You gain the Fly movement mode for one [Round] (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.). At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying] and do not possess the Fly movement mode, you suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM. You may not make a new Acrobatics check to continue your flight without something to jump from.\n\n \nDC 35:\n Leap onto a flying skeletal dragon to confront the lich riding it. Ideally, have some way to get back down in an emergency. You gain the Fly movement mode for two [Rounds]. (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.) At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying] and do not possess the Fly movement mode, you suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM.\n\n \nDC 40:\n \u201cNeo\u2019s doing his Superman thing again.\u201d You gain the Fly movement mode for three [Rounds]. (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.) At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying] and do not possess the Fly movement mode, you suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM.\n\n\nAthletics (Str)\n\n\nAthletics represents your character\u2019s ability to climb and swim. Since all of these can get you into pretty inhospitable areas, high-level athletes also learn to do things like holding their breath for absurd periods of time.\n\n\nBreaking Restraints\n\n\nWith a successful Athletics check, you can break out of physical restraints, such as handcuffs or chains. Breaking out of restraints normally takes 2 [Rounds] of effort, but you can reduce the DC by 2 by taking 5 [Rounds] to attempt to break out, or you can attempt to break out as a standard action if you increase the DC by 5. \n\n\nSome examples of bindings, with appropriate DCs, follow:\n\n\n\n\nDC 15:\n Hastily tied ropes. \n\n\nDC 20:\n Handcuffs or light manacles.\n\n\nDC 25:\n Steel-reinforced straight jacket.\n\n\nDC 30:\n Runed adamantine manacles.\n\n\nDC 35:\n Form-fitted stone or ice.\n\n\nDC 40:\n The crushing gravity of a prison world\n\n\n\n\nClimbing\n\n\nOnce per [Round], you may make an Athletics skill check to begin climbing an obstacle, surface, or even air at half of your normal movement speed. Generally speaking, one check is good enough for a given surface, unless something happens to increase the difficulty of climbing. If your check exceeds the DC of the task by 5 or more, you can move at your full movement speed. A few representative climbing surfaces, with appropriate DCs, follow:\n\n\n\n\nDC 15:\n A steep rocky slope with frequent handholds and footholds and no rattlesnakes at all.\n\n\nDC 20:\n A smooth tree with very few branches.\n\n\nDC 25:\n The outside of a castle wall, in the dead of night.\n\n\nDC 30:\n An overhanging defensive wall kept artificially slick and equipped with fake handholds.\n\n\nDC 35:\n The outside twigs of a never-ending world tree. You can climb the air itself, gaining the Fly movement mode for one [Round]. (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.) At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying], do not possess the Fly movement mode, and you gained the Fly movement mode as the result of an Athletics skill check within the last one [Round], you must make another successful Athletics skill check to gain the Fly movement mode again or suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM.\n\n\nDC 40:\n Falling snowflakes. You gain the Fly movement mode for three [Rounds]. (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.) At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying], do not possess the Fly movement mode, and you gained the Fly movement mode as the result of an Athletics skill check within the last three [Rounds], you must make another successful Athletics skill check to gain the Fly movement mode again or suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM.\n\n\n\n\nSwimming\n\n\nWith a successful Athletics check, you can move through a liquid medium at half your normal movement speed, or surface from [Swimming] as a move action. Generally speaking, one check is good enough for a given medium, unless something happens to impede your ability to swim. If your check exceeds the DC of the task by 5 or more, you can move at your full movement speed. A few representative environments, with appropriate DCs, follow:\n\n \nDC 15:\n A calm pool of cool water.\n\n \nDC 20:\n A cold mountain river.\n\n \nDC 25:\n Frigid river rapids.\n\n \nDC 30:\n An underwater whirlpool with unpredictable outside currents.\n\n \nDC 35:\n A death trap deep within the underwater Sahuagin sanctum.\n\n \nDC 40:\n The leading edge of a tsunami.\n\n\nScaling Bonuses\n\n\nYour training gives you certain bonuses when you have a given number of ranks in Athletics. All of these abilities are considered extraordinary abilities.\n\n \n1 rank:\n You gain a bonus to your movement speed equal to 5 ft, plus an additional 5 ft per 5 ranks you have in Athletics.\n\n \n5 ranks:\n You take no damage from extreme hot or cold weather.\n\n \n10 ranks:\n If your game uses the Suffocation environmental effect, you can hold your breath for 1 minute per point of Constitution, or for 1 [Round] per point of Constitution in a hard vacuum before you begin suffocating.\n\n \n15 ranks:\n You are not damaged by even the most extreme environmental hazards, and automatically succeed on saves against environmental hazards.\n\n\nLarceny (Dex)\n\n\nLarceny is your character\u2019s ability to commit acts of burglary, to disable traps or sabotage equipment, and to perform sleight-of-hand tricks.\n\n\nBurglary\n\n\nWith a successful Larceny check, you can open a lock on a door or safe, non-destructively open a window, or perform similar feats. Practically any of these tasks can be accomplished without a Larceny check by destroying the lock or the material around the lock; however, Larceny checks allow you to subvert any failsafes and accomplish your task without leaving a pile of debris. Generally speaking, there should not be more than two or three Larceny checks of this type required for a given \u201cjob.\u201d If an investigator uses the Perception skill, the DC to detect the forced entry is equal to the result of your Larceny check; exceeding the DC by 5 or more means that the investigator finds a clue that could point to you.\n\n\nA few representative obstacles follow:\n\n\n\n\nDC 15:\n A simple, poorly secured window or gate latch.\n\n\nDC 20:\n The lock on an old treasure chest, or a rusty lock on a door.\n\n\nDC 25:\n A well-made mechanical lock, or a simple magitech combination.\n\n\nDC 30:\n A well-made and advanced mechanical lock, such as a real-world 20th Century combination lock, or a magitech lock with basic security countermeasures.\n\n\nDC 35:\n A magitech lock with personal identification capabilities.\n\n\nDC 40:\n A magitech lock keyed to biological parts of a specific individual or group of individuals.\n\n\n\n\nDisable Device\n\n\nThis function is basically identical to the burglary function in terms of DCs, but allows you to jam a device or even cause it to injure the user. It is, of course, possible to destroy devices without using the Larceny skill; however, this skill allows you to subtly alter a device so it stops functioning. If you rig a device to harm the user, the Larceny DC increases by 2, and the modifications can be spotted with a Perception check with a DC equal to the result of your Larceny check. A Perception check exceeding your Larceny check by 5 or more means that a clue is spotted that could point to the person who caused the malfunction. \n\n\nA few representative devices, with appropriate DCs, follow:\n\n \nDC 15:\n The wheel of a wagon.\n\n \nDC 20:\n The firing mechanism of a crossbow.\n\n \nDC 25:\n The steering mechanism of a ship, possibly including magitech parts. Alternatively, the trigger mechanism of a magic wand.\n\n \nDC 30:\n The mechanism of a watch, or the magical components of a scrying device.\n\n \nDC 35:\n A magitech information-storing terminal.\n\n \nDC 40:\n The decision-making cortex of a golem or other magitech automaton.\n\n\nEscape Artist\n\n\nWith a successful Larceny check, you can worm your way out of physical restraints, such as handcuffs or chains, on your character. Escaping restraints normally takes 2 [Rounds] of effort, but you can reduce the DC by 2 by taking 5 [Rounds] to attempt to escape, or you can attempt to escape as a standard action if you increase the DC by 5.\n\n\n\n\nDC 15:\n An ad-hoc web of belts.\n\n\nDC 20:\n A cloth straight jacket.\n\n\nDC 25:\n Globs and globs of sticky ectoplasm.\n\n\nDC 30:\n An \u201cinescapable\u201d iron box filled with water.\n\n\nDC 35:\n Web of the Spider Queen.\n\n\nDC 40:\n The mystic seal meant to bar your glorious return.\n\n\n\n\nSleight of Hand\n\n\nYou use this function to pick someone\u2019s pocket, conceal an object or weapon on your person, or do magic tricks on street corners. It is always evaluated as a check against a character\u2019s Awareness defense (10 + the creature\u2019s level + the creature\u2019s Wisdom modifier). Picking someone\u2019s pocket is a standard action. Your Larceny check takes a -5 penalty to conceal a weapon from a hand search.\n\n\nTrap-setting\n\n\nWhen setting a trap (such as the ones made available in the ranger\u2019s Professional Soldier track), you can attempt to conceal the trap with a Larceny check (the DC is the Awareness defense of anyone who approaches within 10 ft of the trap). People who are actively searching for traps may make a Perception check, with the result equal to the DC of your Larceny check.\n\n\nStealth (Dex)\n\n\nThe Stealth skill represents your character\u2019s ability to avoid detection by other creatures. It is evaluated as a roll against a creature\u2019s Awareness defense, and if it succeeds, the creature cannot establish a line of sight to you.\n\n\nOnce per [Round], if you are [Concealed], [Fully concealed], or out of line of sight from all opponents, you can make a Stealth check as part of a move action. You retain that check\u2019s result until the end of the [Encounter], until you take an offensive action, or you roll another Stealth check.\n\n\nEach [Round] that you retain a Stealth check\u2019s result, including the [Round] you make your Stealth check, the result of your check is modified by several factors listed below. If your opponent\u2019s Awareness exceeds your modified check result at any time (even after you make the check), your opponent detects you.\n\n\nThe following modifiers are cumulative to all Stealth checks over the course of an [Encounter], but may never exceed +5:\n\n Each time after you take an offensive action, you suffer a -5 penalty.\n\n Each time after you cast a spell that is not an offensive action, use a spell-like or supernatural ability that is not an offensive action, or use an Interaction skill, you suffer a -2 penalty.\n\n You gain a +1 bonus for each range category beyond your opponent\u2019s [Close] range you are from that opponent.\n\n You gain a bonus equal to +2 after each consecutive [Round] in which you haven\u2019t moved.\n* You suffer a -2 penalty if you move more than half your movement speed with a single movement, after that movement.\n\n\nRide (Dex)\n\n\nRide is your character\u2019s ability to effectively use riding animals or vehicles in combat. A character may occupy only one mount at any given time. While any creature can control a mount out of combat, you have a knack for driving while rockets or javelins are flying in your direction.\n\n\n\n\nWhat a Personal Mount Represents: A Personal Mount is the player\u2019s mount of choice, and is the mount they can always seem to find or regain whenever they happen to misplace their ride. Examples include a favorite brand of motorcycle the character knows how to build from scratch with spare parts, the horse that always seems to find its way back, or a type of vehicle that the character owns or can easily find in abundance. The details can vary based on the context of the campaign, so we suggest you work them out with your group.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Mount\n\n\nAt the beginning of each [Scene], if you are trained in the Ride skill and do not already have a Personal Mount, you gain a single mount designated as your Personal Mount, which appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within your [Close] range and has a movement speed equal to your movement speed + 10 ft. Your GM must agree to the size and shape of any mount whose space is not 1 square by 1 square or 2 squares by 2 squares. You may not treat any other mount as your Personal Mount except through GM allowance unless otherwise specified. Whenever another creature becomes the rider of your Personal Mount, that creature gains and possesses each movement mode you currently possess as long as they are the rider of the mount and you continue to possess that movement mode.\n\n\nAt any time, you may voluntarily lose your mount without taking an action. If you do so, any creature that is the mount\u2019s rider ceases to be its rider and the mount cannot have arider again until you regain the mount.\n\n\nVoluntarily Losing a Mount: When you find it nigh impossible to get back on your Personal Mount before the beginning of the next [Scene], you may find it beneficial to voluntarily lose the mount. This guarantees that you regain the mount at beginning of the next [Scene].\n\n\nBattle Rider\n\n\nAs a free action, if you are an occupant of a mount without a rider, you may become its rider. You may cease to be its rider as a free action.\n\n\nDaredevil\n\n\nWhile you are the rider of a mount, you can avoid provoking attacks of opportunity from moving through a creature\u2019s threatened area. Make a successful Ride check (DC equal to 10 + your opponent\u2019s BAB + your opponent\u2019s KOM) to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity; failure means you provoke an attack of opportunity but can still move normally (aside from any consequences of the attack). This DC is increased by 10 for areas within that opponent\u2019s occupied square(s). You also have access to the following special moves:\n\n \nDC 20:\n Board or dismount a mount as part of a move action without provoking an attack of opportunity, rather than as a move action that provokes.\n\n \nDC 25:\n As a swift action, increase your mount\u2019s movement speed by 20 ft for its next movement this [Round]. For every 5 points by which you exceed this DC, you can increase your mount\u2019s movement speed by an additional 5 ft.\n* \nDC 30:\n As part of a move action, dismount any willing allies occupying your mount, deploying them in your choice of unoccupied squares adjacent to the mount.\n\n\nScaling Bonus\n\n\nYour training helps you stay in your seat regardless of whatever calamity you are riding through. You gain a +1 bonus to saves against any effect that would cause you to dismount, plus another +1 bonus for every five ranks you possess in Ride.\n\n\nSurvival (Con)\n\n\nSurvival lies somewhere between raw physical toughness, hearty vim, and iron-skulled grit: the ability to buckle down, cool your head, calm your heart, and unflinchingly take the best the world can throw at you.\n\n\nVitality\n\n\nYou can prepare for pain with a surge of temporary hit points, and eventually to bounce back from more severe injuries and push through debilitating conditions. You can make this check as part of a move action, comparing your result to the list of DCs below to determine its benefits. All temporary HP and [Fast healing] gained from this skill are lost at the beginning of an [Encounter]. Temporary HP gained from this skill stacks with other sources of temporary HP, but not itself, up to a maximum of half your normal maximum HP. [Fast healing] gained from this skill stacks with other sources of [Fast healing], but not itself.\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Identifying Effects\n\n\nGMs, it is up to you as to how often you withhold information, and how much, about the abilities you fling at your players. Players, it is up to you to determine how often you need to know more about what hit you in the face, beyond how much it hurts. Many effects are thrown around in Legend, so please keep that in mind when deciding to attempt identifying an effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDC 20:\n You gain 5 temporary HP. \n\n\nDC 25:\n You gain 10 temporary HP. \n\n\nDC 30:\n You gain 10 temporary HP, and [Fast healing] 5 for one [Round].\n\n\nDC 35:\n You gain 15 temporary HP, and [Fast healing] 5 for two [Rounds].\n\n\nDC 40:\n You gain 15 temporary HP, [Fast healing] 10 for two [Rounds], and you may delay any one condition that is currently affecting you for 1 [Round]: it has no effect and its duration does not change for 1 [Round]. Any condition delayed this way may not be delayed again until the end of the [Encounter].\n\n\nDC 45:\n You gain 20 temporary HP, [Fast healing] 10 for three [Rounds], and you may delay any one condition that is currently affecting you for 1 [Round]; it has no effect and its duration does not change for 1 [Round]. Any condition delayed this way may not be delayed again until the end of the [Encounter].\n\n\nDC 50:\n As DC 45, and you may also remove one condition from yourself from the following list: [Battered], [Bleeding], [Blinded], [Confused], [Dazzled], [Deafened], [Energy drained], [Exhausted],[Fatigued],[Nauseated], [Burning], [Shaken], [Sickened], or [Slowed].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowing Which Effects to Identify\n\n\nAt the GM\u2019s discretion, physical descriptions may be used to differentiate located effects (e.g. \u201cYou see a blue one and a green one\u201d). If the GM does not want to divulge such specific information for free, the located effect to be identified may be chosen randomly.\nBecause different systems of randomization have different benefits we left the final choice up to the GM. A fast solution would be to assign each effect / item a numerical value followed by rolling to see what the player identifies.\n\n\n\n\nScaling Bonuses\n\n\nYour skill at absorbing blows gives you certain bonuses when you have a given number of ranks in Vigor. All of these abilities are considered extraordinary abilities.\n\n \n5 ranks:\n Whenever an effect other than [Fast healing] would heal you any amount of hit points, it heals you that many hit points plus five instead.\n\n \n10 ranks:\n The [Damage reduction] you gain from Constitution is now equal to your Constitution modifier instead of half of your Constitution modifier.\n* \n15 ranks:\n Whenever you would suffer any number of points of [HP reduction], except from any ability you use, you suffer that many points of [HP reduction] minus five instead.",

Finally, each knowledge skill has specific uses in its general \u201cfield\u201d that can affect the game world.\n\n\nIdentify Creature\n\n\nAs a swift action, you can make a Knowledge check to identify a creature.\n\n\nThe DC for identifying a creature is equal to 10 + the creature\u2019s level; a successful check gives you a general idea of the creature\u2019s special powers. For each 5 points by which your Knowledge check exceeds the DC, you can ask a specific question about one of the creature\u2019s defenses or special attacks (such as a numerical value, or which defense is weakest).\n\n\nIdentify Ability\n\n\nYou may identify an ability immediately after you see it used by making a Knowledge check (DC 15 + the level of creature that used the ability). This does not require an action. [Legendary] abilities add +2 to the DC.\n\n\nThe Knowledge skill required for this check depends on the type of ability it is used to identify.

If you succeed, you may also use that that check to identify one magical effect or magic item you have located. For every 5 points by which your Arcana check exceeds the DC, you may identify another located effect or item with an equal or lower DC. You cannot use this skill magical effects with the [Figment] or [Glamer] descriptor.\n\n\nIdentify Located Effects\n\n\nAs a swift action, you can identify magical effects and magic items you have located on a creature or square within your line of sight by making a successful Arcana check (DC 15 + the level of the creature that created the effect or is attuned to the item). Effects that can only be activated by [Legendary] creatures add +2 to the DC. Apply this check to each effect or item being identified but determine the results separately.\n\n\nEngineering (Int)\n\n\nEngineering covers buildings, structures, and mechanical technology.\n\n\nIdentification:\n Creatures with the [Construct] type.\n\n\nStructural Repair\n\n\nYou can repair a fault in a structure or device; or, if it\u2019s a particularly large structure or device that would require more than one person\u2019s work, you can at least figure out how to repair the fault and explain to others how to fix it. The DC is equal to the DC for identifying the fault +2.\n\n\nStructural Design\n\n\nYou can design a new mechanical device or advanced structure. Any implementation of your design requires GM approval. The DC is equal to identifying faults in a similar device +5.\n\n\nIdentify Fault\n\n\nYou can identify faulty structural or mechanical engineering. If you examine a [Average] or smaller device for 5 minutes, you can identify faults or sabotage in the device. A [Large] device must be examined for 15 minutes, and a [Huge] or larger device must be examined for an hour. DCs are outlined below. DC 15: You can identify faults in a basic mechanical device, such as a horse-drawn wagon. Structurally, you can identify faults in a livestock barn.\n\n \nDC 20:\n You can identify faults in a more complex mechanical device, such as a well-built crossbow or (if your setting has them) a double-action revolver.\n\n \nDC 25:\n You can identify faults in a highly complex mechanical device, such as a pocket watch or a self-propelling ship. Structurally, you can identify faults in a suspension bridge.\n\n \nDC 30:\n You can identify faults in the body parts of a golem or other [Construct]. Structurally, you can identify faults in large or particularly mobile structures, such as a submarine.\n\n \nDC 35:\n You can identify faults in the decision-making cortex of a golem or information terminal. You can identify faults in programmable or autonomous structures, such as a hovercar.\n* \nDC 40:\n You can identify faults in truly massive or complex systems, such as a flying city.\n\n\nGeography (Int)\n\n\nGeography covers exactly what it says on the label, including places where no one has gone before.\n\n\nIdentification:\n Creatures with the [Primordial] type.\n\n\nLay of the Land\n\n\nYou can use the Geography skill to locate special routes, recognize or find out about strange places, and anticipate hostile areas.\n\n \nDC 15:\n Travelers through the mountain road are often harassed by bandits. On one cliff, overhanging the road, villagers and caravan drivers alike have seen lights flicker and then go out.\n\n \nDC 20:\n The forest\u2019s trees grow in a unique pattern that allows elves to set up platforms high above the ground. These particular elves believe that \u201cnot-elves\u201d are divinely ordained to serve as target practice, so caution is warranted.\n\n \nDC 25:\n The best way to reach the mountain fortress without aggravating the local giant population is to travel through a strangely-shifting network of ice tunnels. Somehow, you have a very good idea of which turns to take through the tunnels.\n\n \nDC 30:\n The old dwarven forge left lasting marks on the mountain. Somewhere in the mine tunnels, there is a dimensional overlap with the Plane of Elemental Fire.\n\n \nDC 35:\n Several map fragments suggest that a cluster of massive gems can be found deep inside a tunnel network within the Plane of Elemental Earth. In point of fact, there is an entire city carved out of emeralds.\n\n \nDC 40:\n The emerald city is secretly ruled by a dragon illusionist with a mysterious hoard.\n\n\nHistory (Int)\n\n\nThis the discipline of knowing what happened in the past, and sometimes why it happened. In a world with powerful monsters and heroes, the past is an important key to the present and future.\n\n\nIdentification:\n [Legendary] creatures.\n\n\nDig Up the Past\n\n\nYou can come up with the details of someone or something\u2019s past. Identifying and recognizing a [Legendary] creature, an important political figure such as the king or general of a large country, or historical details of a large city is done at the DCs given below. \n\n \nDC 15:\n You know the king and queen\u2019s names, and the names of their parents. \n\n \nDC 20:\n You know the locations of a general\u2019s major battles.\n\n \nDC 25:\n You know the wizard\u2019s favored spells \u2013 or, at least, the ones he\u2019s used in public.\n\n \nDC 30:\n You know what the king\u2019s secret adviser has been doing behind closed doors. Maybe even the rumored glimpses of a scaly, gem-studded hide. Alternatively, you know where to find the wizard\u2019s old and trusted apprentice.\n\n \nDC 35:\n You know the identity of the children who played a crucial part in the lich\u2019s transformation.\n\n \nDC 40:\n You can activate a legend lore effect on your target. This functions in all ways like the spell.\n\n\nThe DCs will be modified in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying a significant, but less well-known individual or smaller city can be done at +2 DC. \n\n\nIdentifying the past of a minor official or large town increases to +5 DC. \n\n\nAn obscure individual or small town can be identified, but the DC is at a steep +7. \n\n\nDCs can be decreased at the GM\u2019s discretion if your character has some kind of local experience or knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nMedicine (Int)\n\n\nMedicine covers the anatomy and physiology of creatures, including methods of putting them back together. Attempting to treat someone with the Medicine skill requires spending the required period of time in relative safety.

A successful check heals 2 points for each level the patient has. You can increase the amount healed or decrease the amount of time required by meeting a higher Medicine DC, as detailed below.

You must be adjacent to your patient when you spend your standard action.\n* \nDC 50:\n Use both of the DC 45 improvements.\n\n\nStabilize Dying Creature\n\n\nYou can make a [Dying] creature [Stable] with a standard action and a DC 25 Medicine check.\n\n\nRevive Unconscious Creature\n\n\nYou can awaken an [Unconscious] creature with 1 minute of care and a successful DC 20 Medicine check.\n\n\nRemove Harmful Condition\n\n\nYou can remove a harmful condition affecting a patient with a successful Medicine check. The DC is equal to the save DC of the effect that inflicted the condition. The time required is based on the duration of the condition; a duration measured in [Rounds] requires a move and a standard action, a duration measured in minutes requires a minute of care, a duration measured in hours requires an hour of care, and a condition measured in days or longer requires eight hours of care.\n\n\nRevive Dead Creature\n\n\nYou can revive a creature that has been [Dead] for no longer than 1 hour per level with an hour of effort and a successful DC 35 Medicine check. You can revive a creature that has been [Dead] for no longer than 1 day per level with an hour of effort and a successful DC 40 Medicine check. Creatures who have been [Dead] for longer than that can be revived at the GM\u2019s discretion, but the DC may be even higher. At the GM\u2019s discretion, creatures who met an especially gruesome end may leave corpses that are too damaged to revive with this skill.\n\n\nNature (Int)\n\n\nThe Nature skill covers the knowledge of the environment and how to get through it without being eaten.\n\n\nIdentification:\n Creatures with the [Animal], [Fey], [Magical beast], or [Plant] type.\n\n\nIdentify Hazard\n\n\nYou can identify environmental hazards of various sorts with enough time to make basic preparations to protect yourself and your allies. The DC increases based on the difficulty of identifying the hazard and the rarity of the hazard. The threats posed by each hazard are explained in Section XI.\n\n\n\n\nDC 15:\n Thunderstorm.\n\n\nDC 20:\n Flash flood.\n\n\nDC 25:\n Tornado.\n\n\nDC 30:\n Earthquake.\n\n\nDC 35:\n Eruption of a long-dormant volcano.\n\n\nDC 40:\n Magically-induced natural disaster.\n\n\n\n\nTracking\n\n\nYou can track or locate a creature with a successful Nature check. A successful tracking attempt allows you to follow a creature that is not using the Stealth skill. If the creature is within your line of sight, you may then immediately locate it. If the creature you are tracking is using the Stealth skill, you gain a +5 bonus to your Awareness defense against that creature\u2019s Stealth check. \n\n\n\n\nDC 15:\n Undisturbed tracks in moist (but not muddy) soil.\n\n\nDC 20:\n Tracks that have been trampled or otherwise disturbed.\n\n\nDC 25:\n Tracks that have been washed away by a storm.\n\n\nDC 30:\n Damaged grass left by halflings on the run.\n\n\nDC 35:\n Disturbed air currents left by a fleeing pixie.\n\n\nDC 40:\n You can activate a scrying effect on any pool of liquid or reflective surface crossed by your target.
