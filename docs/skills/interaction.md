# Interaction Skills

Interaction skills cover your character’s ability to interact with other creatures and secure their cooperation (or at least reduce their ability to thwart your goals). In a combat encounter, each skill allows you to distract or counter opponents; in social encounters, each skill allows you to gain advantages in a negotiation, interrogation, or sim­ilar adversarial setting.

## Bluff (Cha)

*Bluff is your character’s ability to deceive or mis­direct another creature.*


**In a combat encounter,** you can make a Bluff check as part of a move action to render an opponent within [Long] range [Flat-footed] against any attacks you make be­fore the end of your turn.

**In a social encounter,** you can make a Bluff check when attempting to mislead your target about circumstances or capabilities.
 In either case, the DC is equal to 10 + the level of the opponent + the opponent’s Wisdom modifier.

## Diplomacy (Cha)

Diplomacy is your character’s ability to persuade another creature of your rightness or friendliness.

**In a combat encounter,** you can make a Diplomacy check as part of a move action to inflict a -2 penalty on the attack rolls of target oppo­nent within [Long] range until the beginning of your next turn.

**In a social encounter,** you can make a Diplomacy check when attempting to induce coopera­tion by describing common goals, enemies, or values.
In either case, the DC is equal to 10 + the level of the opponent + the opponent’s Intelligence modifier.

## Intimidate (Cha)

Intimidate is your character’s ability to coerce another creature into cooperation with you via direct or indirect threats.

**In a combat encounter,** you can make an Intimidate check as part of a move action to inflict a -1 penalty to the AC and saves of an oppo­nent within [Long] range until the begin­ning of your next turn.

**In a social encounter,** you can make an Intimidate check when attempting to win cooperation by threatening your opponent’s interests or person.
In either case, the DC is equal to 10 + the lev­el of the opponent + the opponent’s Charisma modifier.

## Perception (Wis)

*Perception is your character’s ability to sense your surroundings and the intentions of your opponent.*

You make Perception checks to detect traps or to observe your surroundings to detect clues or anomalies in your environment.

Some abilities and vision modes also allow you to make a special Perception check to detect a creature or creatures using the Stealth skill; in such cases, the DC for your Perception check is 10 + the creature’s total Stealth modifier.

You can also use Perception to identify sabotage; in this case, the DC is equal to the Larceny result of the saboteur.

**In a combat encounter,** you can make a Perception check as part of a move action to in­flict a -2 penalty to the saves of an opponent within [Long] range until the beginning of your next turn.

**In a social encounter,** you can make a Perception check when attempting to evaluate the truth of your opponent’s claims and the vulnerabilities of your opponents.
In either case, the DC is equal to 10 + the level of the opponent + the opponent’s Charisma modifier.
