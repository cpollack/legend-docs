# Combat Alchemist

Alchemy is an ancient and noble art dedicated to revealing the underpinnings of the universe itself. You can also use it to transmute living things into corpses by throwing deadly chemicals in their face.

When you select this track, choose your highest Spellcasting Ability Modifer (SAM), or if you do not have a SAM, your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifer. This becomes your Track Ability Modifer (TAM) for this track. The save DC for abilities under this track is equal to `10 + ½ level + TAM`.


### 1st Circle – Lesser Brewing `EX`

You have the ability to create Brews: potent but short-lived magical concoctions. These concoctions come in three varieties: potions for drinking, poisons that are applied to weapons, and cocktails for throwing into battle. At the beginning of each [Scene], you choose three Brews, plus an additional two Brews for each circle of Combat Alchemist you possess. The chosen Brews are prepared until the end of the [Scene]. At first, you can prepare only Lesser Brews, but you learn to prepare other brews at later circles.

Prepared Brews must be primed before they can be used. You can prime a prepared Brew for imminent use as a move action. Once a Brew is primed, any creature can use it: a creature can drink a potion to gain its benefit, apply a poison to its weapon to increase its potency, or pass any Brew to an ally within [Melee] range as part of a move action (including the one used to prime it). A primed Brew not used by the end of the [Encounter] is wasted. A creature or weapon, respectively, may benefit from more than one potion or poison at a time but cannot benefit from multiple uses of the same potion or poison simultaneously. A poison that has an effect when a creature is hit by the affected weapon and allows that creature to make a saving throw cannot affect a single creature more than once per [Round].

Whenever you make an attack action, you may replace any number of attacks with an equal number of cocktail throws, each targeting a square within [Close] range. These throws provoke attacks of opportunity.

Unless otherwise noted, the effects of any Brew used last until the end of the [Encounter].

### 2nd Circle – Transform `SU`

Your knowledge of esoteric sciences includes the nature of things as well as the supernature of things. You begin each [Encounter] with a number of transmutation points equal to the number of Combat Alchemist circles you possess. Additionally, you gain the following abilities:

#### Exclusion Principle

As an immediate action, when an ally within [Long] range uses a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability with an area of effect, you may spend one transmutation point to exclude any number of creatures from the effect.

#### Conservation of Energy

As a standard action, you may spend one transmutation point to deal damage equal to 1d10 per circle of Combat Alchemist you possess to one creature within [Medium] range and heal another creature within [Medium] range a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect.

#### Assisted Entanglement

As a standard action, you may spend one transmutation point to have two target creatures within [Close] range simultaneously [Teleport] into each other’s squares. The destination squares may be occupied, but only by another target of this ability, and only if both targets leave their squares as part of this ability. A successful Reflex save negates this ability.

### 3rd Circle – Greater Brewing `EX`

You can now prepare Greater Brews in addition to Lesser Brews.

### 4th Circle – Relic Brewing `EX`

You can now prepare Relic Brews in addition to Lesser Brews and Greater Brews.

### 5th Circle – Transmute `SU`

Your mastery of arcane structures continues to grow. You gain the following abilities:

#### Equivalent Exchange

As an immediate action, when an offensive action originating from a creature within your [Medium] range, or whose target is within your [Medium] range, would deal energy damage with the [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire] descriptors, you may spend two transmutation points to have that damage lose those descriptors and gain the [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire] descriptor instead.

#### Nonlocality

As a standard action, you may spend two transmutation points to move the area of any ongoing area-affecting spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability within [Close] range to any other location within [Close] range to which you have line of sight and line of effect. The effect’s creator may make a Will save. A successful Will save negates this ability. You cannot move an ongoing area effect originating from a creature.

#### Philosopher’s Stone

As a standard action, you may spend two transmutation points to transmute the equipment of target creature in [Close] range to heavy and largely useless gold. The target is [Slowed], the target’s item bonus to AC from armor is halved, the target’s deflection bonus to AC from a shield is halved, and if the target is wielding a weapon other than a natural weapon, that weapon loses two weapon properties of the target’s choice and the target takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls made using that weapon. These effects last until the end of the [Encounter]. The target may make a Fortitude save, a Reflex save, and a Will save. A successful Fortitude save prevents the target’s item bonus to AC from armor from being halved. A successful Reflex save prevents the target’s deflection bonus to AC from a shield from being halved. A successful Will save negates the loss of weapon properties and the penalty to attack rolls.

### 6th Circle – Artifact Brewing `EX`

You can now prepare Artifact Brews in addition to Lesser, Greater and Relic Brews. When an artifact poison or potion is applied to a creature or weapon, the duration of any artifact poison or potion already affecting the same target ends. Afer a creature fails its save against a particular artifact poison, it can’t be affected by that poison again until the end of the [Encounter].

### 7th Circle – Transcend `SU`

Your mastery of the esoteric is absolute. You gain the following abilities:

#### Momentum Transfer

As an immediate action, you may spend four transmutation points to cause a creature within [Long] range to be unable to take standard actions for 1 [Round]. A successful Will save negates this effect. If you cause a creature using an ability that requires a standard action to use  to be unable to take standard actions, that creature does not use that ability or expend any uses of that ability.

#### Necromuscular Stimulation

When you die, if you have a Lifewine Brew prepared but not primed, you may spend four transmutation points to cause the Lifewine Brew to boil over into a revivifying gas. If you do so, the Lifewine is consumed, and you are reborn in a bolt of alchemical glory on your next turn with current hit points equal to half of your maximum hit points. Neuromuscular Stimulation can only be used once per [Scene].

#### Carbonization

As a standard action, you may spend four transmutation points to inflict a flesh-hardening curse on a single creature in [Close] range. The creature is [Entangled]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Entangled] condition. Each subsequent [Round], at the beginning of your turn, the creature makes an additional Fortitude save, the effects of which vary depending on its current state, as listed below:

* **Not [Entangled] or [Slowed]**: The creature becomes [Entangled]. A successful save negates the [Entangled] condition and ends the Carbonization ability.
* **[Entangled]**: The creature becomes [Slowed]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Slowed] condition, and removes the [Entangled] condition if it was caused by Carbonization.
* **[Slowed]**: The creature becomes [Entangled]. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Entangled] condition, and removes the [Slowed] condition if it was caused by Carbonization.
* **Both [Entangled] and [Slowed]**: The creature becomes [Petrified] for three [Rounds]. While the affected creature is [Petrified], it does not make saves against Carbonization. It still makes saves against the [Petrified] condition normally. A successful Fortitude save negates the [Petrified] condition, and removes the [Slowed] condition if it was caused by Carbonization.

This effect, and all conditions inflicted by it, end either once the target creature has been [Petrified] by it for 3 [Rounds], or at the end of the [Encounter].

#### Probability Redistribution

As a standard action, you may choose two creatures, causing an exchange of one condition or temporary magical effects from each to the other. Viable effects include spells and spell-like ability targeting that creature with a duration measured in [Rounds], an [Encounter] or a [Scene], and the following conditions:
[Battered], [Bleeding], [Blinded], [Confused], [Cowering], [Dazed], [Dazzled], [Deafened], [Entangled], [Exhausted], [Fatigued], [Frightened], [Nauseated], [Panicked], [Paralyzed], [Petrified], [Shaken], [Sickened] or [Stunned]. If only one of your targets is under a valid effect, you only move a single valid effect from that target to the other target. Both targets must be within [Medium] range, and each can make a Will save to negate this effect. If either succeeds, Probability Redistribution fails entirely.
