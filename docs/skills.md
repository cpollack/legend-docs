# Skills

While your character’s class represents a specialization, and generally defines how they approach combat, skills model their general body of knowledge and supplementary abilities that many adventurers have in common. Two rangers with the same tracks may play very differently if one focuses on sneaking around and sabotaging things, and the other relies on sharp senses and a vast knowledge of different creatures to bring down his enemies.

## Proficient Skills and Skill Ranks

You either have a skill proficiency, or you don’t. You choose proficient skills at 1st level. Proficient skills gain a bonus to their rank equal to half your level.

## Class Skills

Your class grants you a certain number of skills that you are proficient in.  It also determines which skills are your ‘Class’ skills and which skill categories you are strongest in.

Class skills gain half of your character level to their rank.

## Ability Modifier

The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill’s key ability (the ability associated with the skill’s use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.

## Miscellaneous Modifiers

Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, bonuses from active magical effects or items, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.

# Taking 10

Taking 10 and 20 It doesn’t always make sense for actions to carry a random element. When you are not in any danger or otherwise distracted, you may “take 10” – treat a roll of a d20 as a 10 (the average) instead of rolling, to represent an average result. If you have lots of spare time and the action you are attempting carries no consequences for failing (such as straining to open a tight jar) you may treat the result of a d20 roll as a 20, but doing this means that the action takes 20 times as long as normal. In effect, it’s assumed that you’ve rolled the die 20 times until an actual 20 came up. Ultimately, the GM decides when you are permitted to take 10 or 20. Some tracks and feats grant abilities that may allow you to “take” other values.

# Skill Descriptions & Trappings

## Acrobatics (Dex)

Acrobatics is your character’s ability to jump, tumble, and roll around or over obstacles. This includes obstacles that want to stab you. For purposes of dealing with environmental hazards, one Acrobatics check should generally be enough unless something happens to increase the difficulty of that check; for purposes of combat, one check should generally be needed for each [Round] in which you attempt to use a function of the Acrobatics skill.

### Moving Through Threatened Areas

If you wish to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity from moving through a creature’s threatened area, you may make an Acrobatics check (DC equal to 10 + your opponent’s BAB + your opponent’s KOM) when you enter its threatened area. This DC is increased by 10 for areas within that opponent’s occupied square(s). Success means you do not provoke an attack of opportunity; failure means you provoke an attack of opportunity but can still move normally (aside from any consequences of the attack).

### Moving Through Occupied Squares

As part of a move action, you may make an Acrobatics check (DC equal to 15 + your opponent’s BAB + your opponent’s KOM) to enter a square occupied by an opponent who can target you with melee attacks. This does not allow you to end movement in that square.

### Surprising an Opponent

As part of a move action, you can make an Acrobatics check with a DC equal to the Armor Class of an opponent within [Long] range (as per normal partial move actions, if you move with your move action, you halve your movement speed for that movement). If you succeed, your opponent loses track of you and is [Flat-footed] against any attacks you make on your turn. If you attempted to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity as part of the same move action, don’t make two Acrobatics checks – compare the same check to each DC and determine the results separately.

### Balancing

If you would suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, you may make a Balance check instead, with a DC chosen by the GM that corresponds to a surface or object that you can use to keep from falling. If you succeed, you do not suffer that fall. Instead, you become able to stand on the surface or object as if on solid ground until you suffer another Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge (you do not lose the [Flying] condition from this). A few representative objects, with appropriate DCs, follow:
* **DC 15:** Slick floor in a grocery store. The kind that require signs so people don’t slip and hurt themselves. Alternatively, an oil slick on a road.
* **DC 20:** Icy rock. 
* **DC 25:** Rain-slick precipice of darkness, or an inch-thick tree branch.
* **DC 30:** The point of a spear (obviously, without being impaled). This cannot get you un-stabbed if someone successfully attacks you.
* **DC 35:** The grains of sand in a desert storm.
* **DC 40:** Clouds.

### Jumping

Once per [Round], you may make an Acrobatics skill check to jump over an obstacle or jump high into the air.
* **DC 15:** Cross a fast stream without getting your boots wet.
* **DC 20:** Jump from one roof to another, with a narrow alley separating them.
* **DC 25:** Jump from one roof to another, across a street. Alternatively, vault an ogre-proof fence.
* **DC 30:** Leap onto the back of a charging war elephant. You gain the Fly movement mode for one [Round] (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.). At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying] and do not possess the Fly movement mode, you suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM. You may not make a new Acrobatics check to continue your flight without something to jump from.
* **DC 35:** Leap onto a flying skeletal dragon to confront the lich riding it. Ideally, have some way to get back down in an emergency. You gain the Fly movement mode for two [Rounds]. (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.) At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying] and do not possess the Fly movement mode, you suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM.
* **DC 40:** “Neo’s doing his Superman thing again.” You gain the Fly movement mode for three [Rounds]. (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.) At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying] and do not possess the Fly movement mode, you suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM.

## Athletics (Str)

Athletics represents your character’s ability to climb and swim. Since all of these can get you into pretty inhospitable areas, high-level athletes also learn to do things like holding their breath for absurd periods of time.

### Breaking Restraints

With a successful Athletics check, you can break out of physical restraints, such as handcuffs or chains. Breaking out of restraints normally takes 2 [Rounds] of effort, but you can reduce the DC by 2 by taking 5 [Rounds] to attempt to break out, or you can attempt to break out as a standard action if you increase the DC by 5. 

Some examples of bindings, with appropriate DCs, follow:

* **DC 15:** Hastily tied ropes. 
* **DC 20:** Handcuffs or light manacles.
* **DC 25:** Steel-reinforced straight jacket.
* **DC 30:** Runed adamantine manacles.
* **DC 35:** Form-fitted stone or ice.
* **DC 40:** The crushing gravity of a prison world

### Climbing

Once per [Round], you may make an Athletics skill check to begin climbing an obstacle, surface, or even air at half of your normal movement speed. Generally speaking, one check is good enough for a given surface, unless something happens to increase the difficulty of climbing. If your check exceeds the DC of the task by 5 or more, you can move at your full movement speed. A few representative climbing surfaces, with appropriate DCs, follow:

* **DC 15:** A steep rocky slope with frequent handholds and footholds and no rattlesnakes at all.
* **DC 20:** A smooth tree with very few branches.
* **DC 25:** The outside of a castle wall, in the dead of night.
* **DC 30:** An overhanging defensive wall kept artificially slick and equipped with fake handholds.
* **DC 35:** The outside twigs of a never-ending world tree. You can climb the air itself, gaining the Fly movement mode for one [Round]. (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.) At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying], do not possess the Fly movement mode, and you gained the Fly movement mode as the result of an Athletics skill check within the last one [Round], you must make another successful Athletics skill check to gain the Fly movement mode again or suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM.
* **DC 40:** Falling snowflakes. You gain the Fly movement mode for three [Rounds]. (You may immediately use a free action to lift off, gaining the [Flying] condition.) At the beginning of your turn, if you are [Flying], do not possess the Fly movement mode, and you gained the Fly movement mode as the result of an Athletics skill check within the last three [Rounds], you must make another successful Athletics skill check to gain the Fly movement mode again or suffer a Trivial Fall, Hazardous Fall, or Dramatic Plunge, as determined by the GM.

### Swimming

With a successful Athletics check, you can move through a liquid medium at half your normal movement speed, or surface from [Swimming] as a move action. Generally speaking, one check is good enough for a given medium, unless something happens to impede your ability to swim. If your check exceeds the DC of the task by 5 or more, you can move at your full movement speed. A few representative environments, with appropriate DCs, follow:
* **DC 15:** A calm pool of cool water.
* **DC 20:** A cold mountain river.
* **DC 25:** Frigid river rapids.
* **DC 30:** An underwater whirlpool with unpredictable outside currents.
* **DC 35:** A death trap deep within the underwater Sahuagin sanctum.
* **DC 40:** The leading edge of a tsunami.

### Scaling Bonuses

Your training gives you certain bonuses when you have a given number of ranks in Athletics. All of these abilities are considered extraordinary abilities.
* **1 rank:** You gain a bonus to your movement speed equal to 5 ft, plus an additional 5 ft per 5 ranks you have in Athletics.
* **5 ranks:** You take no damage from extreme hot or cold weather.
* **10 ranks:** If your game uses the Suffocation environmental effect, you can hold your breath for 1 minute per point of Constitution, or for 1 [Round] per point of Constitution in a hard vacuum before you begin suffocating.
* **15 ranks:** You are not damaged by even the most extreme environmental hazards, and automatically succeed on saves against environmental hazards.

## Larceny (Dex)

Larceny is your character’s ability to commit acts of burglary, to disable traps or sabotage equipment, and to perform sleight-of-hand tricks.

### Burglary

With a successful Larceny check, you can open a lock on a door or safe, non-destructively open a window, or perform similar feats. Practically any of these tasks can be accomplished without a Larceny check by destroying the lock or the material around the lock; however, Larceny checks allow you to subvert any failsafes and accomplish your task without leaving a pile of debris. Generally speaking, there should not be more than two or three Larceny checks of this type required for a given “job.” If an investigator uses the Perception skill, the DC to detect the forced entry is equal to the result of your Larceny check; exceeding the DC by 5 or more means that the investigator finds a clue that could point to you.

A few representative obstacles follow:

* **DC 15:** A simple, poorly secured window or gate latch.
* **DC 20:** The lock on an old treasure chest, or a rusty lock on a door.
* **DC 25:** A well-made mechanical lock, or a simple magitech combination.
* **DC 30:** A well-made and advanced mechanical lock, such as a real-world 20th Century combination lock, or a magitech lock with basic security countermeasures.
* **DC 35:** A magitech lock with personal identification capabilities.
* **DC 40:** A magitech lock keyed to biological parts of a specific individual or group of individuals.

### Disable Device

This function is basically identical to the burglary function in terms of DCs, but allows you to jam a device or even cause it to injure the user. It is, of course, possible to destroy devices without using the Larceny skill; however, this skill allows you to subtly alter a device so it stops functioning. If you rig a device to harm the user, the Larceny DC increases by 2, and the modifications can be spotted with a Perception check with a DC equal to the result of your Larceny check. A Perception check exceeding your Larceny check by 5 or more means that a clue is spotted that could point to the person who caused the malfunction. 

A few representative devices, with appropriate DCs, follow:
* **DC 15:** The wheel of a wagon.
* **DC 20:** The firing mechanism of a crossbow.
* **DC 25:** The steering mechanism of a ship, possibly including magitech parts. Alternatively, the trigger mechanism of a magic wand.
* **DC 30:** The mechanism of a watch, or the magical components of a scrying device.
* **DC 35:** A magitech information-storing terminal.
* **DC 40:** The decision-making cortex of a golem or other magitech automaton.

### Escape Artist

With a successful Larceny check, you can worm your way out of physical restraints, such as handcuffs or chains, on your character. Escaping restraints normally takes 2 [Rounds] of effort, but you can reduce the DC by 2 by taking 5 [Rounds] to attempt to escape, or you can attempt to escape as a standard action if you increase the DC by 5.

* **DC 15:** An ad-hoc web of belts.
* **DC 20:** A cloth straight jacket.
* **DC 25:** Globs and globs of sticky ectoplasm.
* **DC 30:** An “inescapable” iron box filled with water.
* **DC 35:** Web of the Spider Queen.
* **DC 40:** The mystic seal meant to bar your glorious return.

### Sleight of Hand

You use this function to pick someone’s pocket, conceal an object or weapon on your person, or do magic tricks on street corners. It is always evaluated as a check against a character’s Awareness defense (10 + the creature’s level + the creature’s Wisdom modifier). Picking someone’s pocket is a standard action. Your Larceny check takes a -5 penalty to conceal a weapon from a hand search.

### Trap-setting

When setting a trap (such as the ones made available in the ranger’s Professional Soldier track), you can attempt to conceal the trap with a Larceny check (the DC is the Awareness defense of anyone who approaches within 10 ft of the trap). People who are actively searching for traps may make a Perception check, with the result equal to the DC of your Larceny check.

### Stealth (Dex)

The Stealth skill represents your character’s ability to avoid detection by other creatures. It is evaluated as a roll against a creature’s Awareness defense, and if it succeeds, the creature cannot establish a line of sight to you.

Once per [Round], if you are [Concealed], [Fully concealed], or out of line of sight from all opponents, you can make a Stealth check as part of a move action. You retain that check’s result until the end of the [Encounter], until you take an offensive action, or you roll another Stealth check.

Each [Round] that you retain a Stealth check’s result, including the [Round] you make your Stealth check, the result of your check is modified by several factors listed below. If your opponent’s Awareness exceeds your modified check result at any time (even after you make the check), your opponent detects you.

The following modifiers are cumulative to all Stealth checks over the course of an [Encounter], but may never exceed +5:
* Each time after you take an offensive action, you suffer a -5 penalty.
* Each time after you cast a spell that is not an offensive action, use a spell-like or supernatural ability that is not an offensive action, or use an Interaction skill, you suffer a -2 penalty.
* You gain a +1 bonus for each range category beyond your opponent’s [Close] range you are from that opponent.
* You gain a bonus equal to +2 after each consecutive [Round] in which you haven’t moved.
* You suffer a -2 penalty if you move more than half your movement speed with a single movement, after that movement.

## Ride (Dex)

Ride is your character’s ability to effectively use riding animals or vehicles in combat. A character may occupy only one mount at any given time. While any creature can control a mount out of combat, you have a knack for driving while rockets or javelins are flying in your direction.

> What a Personal Mount Represents: A Personal Mount is the player’s mount of choice, and is the mount they can always seem to find or regain whenever they happen to misplace their ride. Examples include a favorite brand of motorcycle the character knows how to build from scratch with spare parts, the horse that always seems to find its way back, or a type of vehicle that the character owns or can easily find in abundance. The details can vary based on the context of the campaign, so we suggest you work them out with your group.

### Personal Mount

At the beginning of each [Scene], if you are trained in the Ride skill and do not already have a Personal Mount, you gain a single mount designated as your Personal Mount, which appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within your [Close] range and has a movement speed equal to your movement speed + 10 ft. Your GM must agree to the size and shape of any mount whose space is not 1 square by 1 square or 2 squares by 2 squares. You may not treat any other mount as your Personal Mount except through GM allowance unless otherwise specified. Whenever another creature becomes the rider of your Personal Mount, that creature gains and possesses each movement mode you currently possess as long as they are the rider of the mount and you continue to possess that movement mode.

At any time, you may voluntarily lose your mount without taking an action. If you do so, any creature that is the mount’s rider ceases to be its rider and the mount cannot have arider again until you regain the mount.

Voluntarily Losing a Mount: When you find it nigh impossible to get back on your Personal Mount before the beginning of the next [Scene], you may find it beneficial to voluntarily lose the mount. This guarantees that you regain the mount at beginning of the next [Scene].

### Battle Rider

As a free action, if you are an occupant of a mount without a rider, you may become its rider. You may cease to be its rider as a free action.

### Daredevil

While you are the rider of a mount, you can avoid provoking attacks of opportunity from moving through a creature’s threatened area. Make a successful Ride check (DC equal to 10 + your opponent’s BAB + your opponent’s KOM) to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity; failure means you provoke an attack of opportunity but can still move normally (aside from any consequences of the attack). This DC is increased by 10 for areas within that opponent’s occupied square(s). You also have access to the following special moves:
* **DC 20:** Board or dismount a mount as part of a move action without provoking an attack of opportunity, rather than as a move action that provokes.
* **DC 25:** As a swift action, increase your mount’s movement speed by 20 ft for its next movement this [Round]. For every 5 points by which you exceed this DC, you can increase your mount’s movement speed by an additional 5 ft.
* **DC 30:** As part of a move action, dismount any willing allies occupying your mount, deploying them in your choice of unoccupied squares adjacent to the mount.

### Scaling Bonus

Your training helps you stay in your seat regardless of whatever calamity you are riding through. You gain a +1 bonus to saves against any effect that would cause you to dismount, plus another +1 bonus for every five ranks you possess in Ride.

## Survival (Con)

Survival lies somewhere between raw physical toughness, hearty vim, and iron-skulled grit: the ability to buckle down, cool your head, calm your heart, and unflinchingly take the best the world can throw at you.

### Vitality

You can prepare for pain with a surge of temporary hit points, and eventually to bounce back from more severe injuries and push through debilitating conditions. You can make this check as part of a move action, comparing your result to the list of DCs below to determine its benefits. All temporary HP and [Fast healing] gained from this skill are lost at the beginning of an [Encounter]. Temporary HP gained from this skill stacks with other sources of temporary HP, but not itself, up to a maximum of half your normal maximum HP. [Fast healing] gained from this skill stacks with other sources of [Fast healing], but not itself.

> #### A Note on Identifying Effects
>GMs, it is up to you as to how often you withhold information, and how much, about the abilities you fling at your players. Players, it is up to you to determine how often you need to know more about what hit you in the face, beyond how much it hurts. Many effects are thrown around in Legend, so please keep that in mind when deciding to attempt identifying an effect.

* **DC 20:** You gain 5 temporary HP. 
* **DC 25:** You gain 10 temporary HP. 
* **DC 30:** You gain 10 temporary HP, and [Fast healing] 5 for one [Round].
* **DC 35:** You gain 15 temporary HP, and [Fast healing] 5 for two [Rounds].
* **DC 40:** You gain 15 temporary HP, [Fast healing] 10 for two [Rounds], and you may delay any one condition that is currently affecting you for 1 [Round]: it has no effect and its duration does not change for 1 [Round]. Any condition delayed this way may not be delayed again until the end of the [Encounter].
* **DC 45:** You gain 20 temporary HP, [Fast healing] 10 for three [Rounds], and you may delay any one condition that is currently affecting you for 1 [Round]; it has no effect and its duration does not change for 1 [Round]. Any condition delayed this way may not be delayed again until the end of the [Encounter].
* **DC 50:** As DC 45, and you may also remove one condition from yourself from the following list: [Battered], [Bleeding], [Blinded], [Confused], [Dazzled], [Deafened], [Energy drained], [Exhausted],[Fatigued],[Nauseated], [Burning], [Shaken], [Sickened], or [Slowed].

>#### Knowing Which Effects to Identify
>
>At the GM’s discretion, physical descriptions may be used to differentiate located effects (e.g. “You see a blue one and a green one”). If the GM does not want to divulge such specific information for free, the located effect to be identified may be chosen randomly.
Because different systems of randomization have different benefits we left the final choice up to the GM. A fast solution would be to assign each effect / item a numerical value followed by rolling to see what the player identifies.

### Scaling Bonuses

Your skill at absorbing blows gives you certain bonuses when you have a given number of ranks in Vigor. All of these abilities are considered extraordinary abilities.
* **5 ranks:** Whenever an effect other than [Fast healing] would heal you any amount of hit points, it heals you that many hit points plus five instead.
* **10 ranks:** The [Damage reduction] you gain from Constitution is now equal to your Constitution modifier instead of half of your Constitution modifier.
* **15 ranks:** Whenever you would suffer any number of points of [HP reduction], except from any ability you use, you suffer that many points of [HP reduction] minus five instead.

# Knowledge Skills

All knowledge skills have a primary function – identifying creatures, objects, and devices. Each knowledge skill represents a general category, something like an academic department at a university. Certain feats and class features allow you to use successful knowledge checks to gain mechanical bonuses against your opponents in a combat, in addition to the tactical advantages of knowing a monster’s mechanical strengths and weaknesses. Finally, each knowledge skill has specific uses in its general “field” that can affect the game world.

## Identify Creature

As a swift action, you can make a Knowledge check to identify a creature.

The DC for identifying a creature is equal to 10 + the creature’s level; a successful check gives you a general idea of the creature’s special powers. For each 5 points by which your Knowledge check exceeds the DC, you can ask a specific question about one of the creature’s defenses or special attacks (such as a numerical value, or which defense is weakest).

### Identify Ability

You may identify an ability immediately after you see it used by making a Knowledge check (DC 15 + the level of creature that used the ability). This does not require an action. [Legendary] abilities add +2 to the DC.

The Knowledge skill required for this check depends on the type of ability it is used to identify. Extraordinary abilities and abilities granted by a race, [Racial] feat, or racial track are identified with the Knowledge skill normally used to identify creatures of the user’s type. Spells, supernatural, and spell-like abilities are identified with the Arcana skill.

## Arcana (Int)

Arcana covers information about magic and spellcasting, along with technology based on or powered by magic.

**Identification:** Creatures with the [Aberration] or [Outsider] type.

### Locate and Identify Magical Effects

As a move action, you may locate magical effects and magic items on a creature or square within your line of sight out to [Close] range by making an Arcana check (DC 20 + the level of the creature that created the effect or is attuned to the item). If you succeed, you may also use that that check to identify one magical effect or magic item you have located. For every 5 points by which your Arcana check exceeds the DC, you may identify another located effect or item with an equal or lower DC. You cannot use this skill magical effects with the [Figment] or [Glamer] descriptor.

### Identify Located Effects

As a swift action, you can identify magical effects and magic items you have located on a creature or square within your line of sight by making a successful Arcana check (DC 15 + the level of the creature that created the effect or is attuned to the item). Effects that can only be activated by [Legendary] creatures add +2 to the DC. Apply this check to each effect or item being identified but determine the results separately.

# Engineering (Int)

Engineering covers buildings, structures, and mechanical technology.

**Identification:** Creatures with the [Construct] type.

## Structural Repair

You can repair a fault in a structure or device; or, if it’s a particularly large structure or device that would require more than one person’s work, you can at least figure out how to repair the fault and explain to others how to fix it. The DC is equal to the DC for identifying the fault +2.

## Structural Design

You can design a new mechanical device or advanced structure. Any implementation of your design requires GM approval. The DC is equal to identifying faults in a similar device +5.

## Identify Fault

You can identify faulty structural or mechanical engineering. If you examine a [Average] or smaller device for 5 minutes, you can identify faults or sabotage in the device. A [Large] device must be examined for 15 minutes, and a [Huge] or larger device must be examined for an hour. DCs are outlined below. DC 15: You can identify faults in a basic mechanical device, such as a horse-drawn wagon. Structurally, you can identify faults in a livestock barn.
* **DC 20:** You can identify faults in a more complex mechanical device, such as a well-built crossbow or (if your setting has them) a double-action revolver.
* **DC 25:** You can identify faults in a highly complex mechanical device, such as a pocket watch or a self-propelling ship. Structurally, you can identify faults in a suspension bridge.
* **DC 30:** You can identify faults in the body parts of a golem or other [Construct]. Structurally, you can identify faults in large or particularly mobile structures, such as a submarine.
* **DC 35:** You can identify faults in the decision-making cortex of a golem or information terminal. You can identify faults in programmable or autonomous structures, such as a hovercar.
* **DC 40:** You can identify faults in truly massive or complex systems, such as a flying city.

# Geography (Int)
Geography covers exactly what it says on the label, including places where no one has gone before.

**Identification:** Creatures with the [Primordial] type.

## Lay of the Land

You can use the Geography skill to locate special routes, recognize or find out about strange places, and anticipate hostile areas.
* **DC 15:** Travelers through the mountain road are often harassed by bandits. On one cliff, overhanging the road, villagers and caravan drivers alike have seen lights flicker and then go out.
* **DC 20:** The forest’s trees grow in a unique pattern that allows elves to set up platforms high above the ground. These particular elves believe that “not-elves” are divinely ordained to serve as target practice, so caution is warranted.
* **DC 25:** The best way to reach the mountain fortress without aggravating the local giant population is to travel through a strangely-shifting network of ice tunnels. Somehow, you have a very good idea of which turns to take through the tunnels.
* **DC 30:** The old dwarven forge left lasting marks on the mountain. Somewhere in the mine tunnels, there is a dimensional overlap with the Plane of Elemental Fire.
* **DC 35:** Several map fragments suggest that a cluster of massive gems can be found deep inside a tunnel network within the Plane of Elemental Earth. In point of fact, there is an entire city carved out of emeralds.
* **DC 40:** The emerald city is secretly ruled by a dragon illusionist with a mysterious hoard.

## History (Int)

This the discipline of knowing what happened in the past, and sometimes why it happened. In a world with powerful monsters and heroes, the past is an important key to the present and future.

**Identification:** [Legendary] creatures.

### Dig Up the Past

You can come up with the details of someone or something’s past. Identifying and recognizing a [Legendary] creature, an important political figure such as the king or general of a large country, or historical details of a large city is done at the DCs given below. 
* **DC 15:** You know the king and queen’s names, and the names of their parents. 
* **DC 20:** You know the locations of a general’s major battles.
* **DC 25:** You know the wizard’s favored spells – or, at least, the ones he’s used in public.
* **DC 30:** You know what the king’s secret adviser has been doing behind closed doors. Maybe even the rumored glimpses of a scaly, gem-studded hide. Alternatively, you know where to find the wizard’s old and trusted apprentice.
* **DC 35:** You know the identity of the children who played a crucial part in the lich’s transformation.
* **DC 40:** You can activate a legend lore effect on your target. This functions in all ways like the spell.

The DCs will be modified in the following ways:

* Identifying a significant, but less well-known individual or smaller city can be done at +2 DC. 
* Identifying the past of a minor official or large town increases to +5 DC. 
* An obscure individual or small town can be identified, but the DC is at a steep +7. 
* DCs can be decreased at the GM’s discretion if your character has some kind of local experience or knowledge.

## Medicine (Int)

Medicine covers the anatomy and physiology of creatures, including methods of putting them back together. Attempting to treat someone with the Medicine skill requires spending the required period of time in relative safety. If the medic or the person being healed are successfully attacked and damaged during the medical procedure, the attempt automatically fails.

**Identification:** Creatures with the [Humanoid], [Giant], and [Undead] type.

### Heal Creature

You can restore the health of a creature with 0 or more hit points with 8 hours of care and a successful DC 15 Medicine check. A successful check heals 2 points for each level the patient has. You can increase the amount healed or decrease the amount of time required by meeting a higher Medicine DC, as detailed below. At each 5-point increment, you can also choose to use both of the improvements available at the previous increment (so a DC 25 check enables you to heal 3× your patient’s level in 4 hours).
* **DC 20:** Increase amount of healing to 3× patient’s level, or reduce time required to 4 hours.
* **DC 25:** Increase amount of healing to 4× patient’s level, or reduce time required to 2 hours.
* **DC 30:** Increase amount of healing to 5× patient’s level, or reduce time required to 1 hour.
* **DC 35:** Increase amount of healing to 6× patient’s level, or reduce time required to half an hour.
* **DC 40:** Increase amount of healing to 7× patient’s level, or reduce time required to a single 5-minute rest.
* **DC 45:** Heal 8× patient’s level, or reduce time required to a standard action for you and a move action for the patient (both actions must be spent in the same [Round]’s time, and you must spend your standard action first). You must be adjacent to your patient when you spend your standard action.

### Stabilize Dying Creature

You can make a [Dying] creature [Stable] with a standard action and a DC 25 Medicine check.

### Revive Unconscious Creature

You can awaken an [Unconscious] creature with 1 minute of care and a successful DC 20 Medicine check.

### Remove Harmful Condition

You can remove a harmful condition affecting a patient with a successful Medicine check. The DC is equal to the save DC of the effect that inflicted the condition. The time required is based on the duration of the condition; a duration measured in [Rounds] requires a move and a standard action, a duration measured in minutes requires a minute of care, a duration measured in hours requires an hour of care, and a condition measured in days or longer requires eight hours of care.

### Revive Dead Creature

You can revive a creature that has been [Dead] for no longer than 1 hour per level with an hour of effort and a successful DC 35 Medicine check. You can revive a creature that has been [Dead] for no longer than 1 day per level with an hour of effort and a successful DC 40 Medicine check. Creatures who have been [Dead] for longer than that can be revived at the GM’s discretion, but the DC may be even higher. At the GM’s discretion, creatures who met an especially gruesome end may leave corpses that are too damaged to revive with this skill.

## Nature (Int)

The Nature skill covers the knowledge of the environment and how to get through it without being eaten.

**Identification:** Creatures with the [Animal], [Fey], [Magical beast], or [Plant] type.

### Identify Hazard

You can identify environmental hazards of various sorts with enough time to make basic preparations to protect yourself and your allies. The DC increases based on the difficulty of identifying the hazard and the rarity of the hazard. The threats posed by each hazard are explained in Section XI.

### Tracking

You can track or locate a creature with a successful Nature check. A successful tracking attempt allows you to follow a creature that is not using the Stealth skill.

If the creature you are tracking is using the Stealth skill, you gain a +5 bonus to your Awareness defense against that creature’s Stealth check.

* **DC 20:** Tracks that have been trampled or otherwise disturbed.
