The body and mind of a living being hold great and powerful secrets, for the Self is more than it is made out to be. Monks know this better than anyone else; whether it be through profound introspection or grueling training, the monk transforms a frail and transient body into a most grievous weapon, capable of feats that defy belief. The philosophies of the monks are as many as the stars in the sky, but nearly all are possessed of a powerful drive to go beyond what is humanly possible.

# Party Role

Monks have very good defenses and incredible speed, allowing them to rush past enemy lines and disable or kill priority targets with quick, powerful strikes.

# Monks in Your Game

The monk can represent almost any kind of wrestler, unarmed fighter, mystic or wanderer sworn to poverty. Their special abilities and great speed can make them terrifying assassins and elusive spies.

Many monasteries and dojos train their own monks with a unique fighting style. To reflect the emphasis of the monk’s training, choose any two saving throws to use the Good progression. The remaining saving throw uses the Poor progression.

# Offensive Style

The following tracks are meant to represent the primary form the monk's combat takes when neutralizing their opponent. Each of the choices below is mutually exclusive with others in this section.

## Discipline of the Serpent

### 1st Circle – External Techniques `EX`

Choose five weapon properties other than `[Arcane]`, `[Barbed]`, `[Distant]`, `[Hold-out]` or `[Quick-draw]`. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon’s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.

Additionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties
your Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses. You may grant it 2 such properties at 1st circle, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, and 5 at 7th. The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.

Attacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the `[Precision]` descriptor equal to your level.

### 2nd Circle – Internal Principles `EX`

Your combat maneuvers, and opponents’ attempts to escape or act in a `[Grappled]` or `[Pinned]` condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:

#### Pushing Blow

As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 5 f, and you can choose to move into their previously occupied space. If you choose not to move into their space, you may instead push them 5 f in the same direction per circle of Discipline of the Serpent you possess.

These movements do not provoke attacks of opportunity. A successful Pushing Blow benefits from abilities that would enhance a successful Bull Rush.

#### Neutralize

As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Will save or take a penalty to damage equal to the number of circles you possess in Discipline of the Serpent for 1 `[Round]`. This penalty does not stack with itself.

### 3rd Circle – Open and Close `EX`

You gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:

#### Close Meridian

As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or be `[Sickened]` for 1 `[Round]`.

#### Open Gate

As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Will save or all creatures gain a +2 bonus to skill checks against the target and saves against the target’s abilities for 1 `[Round]`.

In addition, when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip, you may immediately make a `[Bonus attack]`.

### 4th Circle – Ceaseless Flow `EX`

Once per `[Round]`, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this `[Round]`.

If you replace a `[Bonus attack]` using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your `[Bonus attack]` for that `[Round]`.

### 5th Circle – Stop the Breath `EX`

Your combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip, it is `[Flat-footed]` until the beginning of its next turn.

### 6th Circle – Poison the Blood `EX`

Each time you deal `[Precision]` damage to an opponent with Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip during an attack action, or an opponent fails a save against any of those combat maneuvers during an attack action you make, that opponent gains an `[Imbalance]`.

These `[Imbalances]` cause the opponent to gain various conditions, as below, and have no other effects on the opponent. `[Imbalances]` disappear at the end of each attack action, but conditions your opponents have gained from this ability do not disappear when `[Imbalances]` do.

* Two `[Imbalances]`: The opponent is `[Battered]` for 2 `[Rounds]`.
* Four `[Imbalances]`: The opponent is `[Blinded]` for 1 `[Round]`.
* Six `[Imbalances]`: The opponent is `[Slowed]` for 1 `[Round]`.
* Eight `[Imbalances]`: The opponent is `[Nauseated]` for 1 `[Round]`.
* Ten `[Imbalances]`: The opponent is `[Stunned]` for 1 `[Round]`.

If multiple opponents would gain `[Imbalances]` from a single combat maneuver, you instead
choose one of those opponents to gain an `[Imbalance]`.

### 7th Circle – On Power `EX`

You can now use Ceaseless Flow any number of times per `[Round]`, and Stop the Breath now affects any opponent you hit with Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip, regardless of whether they successfully save against it or not.

## Disciple of the Tiger

### 1st Circle – External Techniques `EX`

Choose five weapon properties other than `[Arcane]`, `[Barbed]`, `[Distant]`, `[Hold-out]` or `[Quick-draw]`. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon’s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.

Additionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties
your Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses. You may grant it 2 such properties at 1st circle, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, and 5 at 7th. The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.

Attacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the `[Precision]` descriptor equal to your level.

### 2nd Circle - Aerial Ace `EX`

Your combat maneuvers, and opponents’ attempts to escape or act in a `[Grappled]` or `[Pinned]` condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:

#### Uppercut
Swinging in a upward motion, you knock a target into the air. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Reflex save or begin `[Flying]`. While the target does not possess the Fly movement mode, they are unable to move until the end of your turn. If the target does not possess the Fly movement mode at the end of your turn, they cease `[Flying]`. 

If the target never possessed the Fly movement mode from when you used Uppercut on them until the end of your turn, they take 1d6 fall damage per circle of Discipline of the Tiger you possess. If they are over a `[Swimming]` area, this damage is halved.

#### Axe Kick

Swinging in a downward motion, you slam a target to the ground. As a standard action while `[Flying]`, you make a single melee attack against a `[Flying]` target that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Reflex save or cease `[Flying]` and take 1d6 fall damage per circle of Discipline of the Tiger you possess. If they are over a `[Swimming]` area, this damage is halved. If the target had previously failed their save against Uppercut during your turn, they suffer the damage from that Combat Maneuver when they take the damage from this Combat Maneuver.

For both of these Combat Maneuvers, you can not provoke an Attack of Opportunity from your target from after you hit them until the end of your turn if they failed their save against said Combat Maneuver.

### 3rd Circle - Relentless Pursuit `EX`

You gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:

#### Flying Strike

You approach your enemy at high speed, utilizing your momentum to deal a blow. As a standard action, you may move up to your speed in a straight line and make a single melee attack. Any obstruction in a straight-line path prevents you from using Flying Strike (although you could maneuver to a straight-line path, if one exists, with your move action). You are not required to move and may change movement modes at the end of your movement (or lack thereof). 

You do not provoke an Attack of Opportunity from your target or anybody along your path, and you only provoke an Attack of Opportunity from enemies threatening your initial position if you have not hit and damaged them with a melee attack this round.

#### Forceful Blow

You deliver a powerful strike to an enemy's center of gravity, sending them careening away. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or be pushed in 1 direction a distance equal to your movement speed. This movement does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.

In addition, when an opponent fails a save against a combat maneuver you perform you may immediately make a `[Bonus attack]`. If you strike a target with a combat maneuver that does not prompt a save, you may force the target to make a Reflex save.  If the target fails this save, you may make a `[Bonus Attack]`.

### 4th Circle – Ceaseless Flow `EX`

Once per `[Round]`, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this `[Round]`.

If you replace a `[Bonus attack]` using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your `[Bonus attack]` for that `[Round]`.

### 5th Circle – Stop the Breath `EX`

Your combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Axe Kick, Disarm, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut, it is `[Flat-footed]` until the beginning of its next turn.

### 6th Circle - Rocket Punch `EX`

A living weapon, you literally launch yourself at your target. Once per `[Encounter]` when using Ceaseless Flow, you may replace your attack with both a Flying Strike and a Forceful Blow. For this ability, the movement range for Flying Strike is doubled, and the DC for Forceful Blow is increased by 1. On a critical hit with an attack affected by this ability, the DC for Forceful Blow is instead increased by 2, and an opponent failing their Fortitude save against Forceful Blow is `[Blown Away]` the distance they would have been pushed.

### 7th Circle – On Power `EX`

You can now use Ceaseless Flow any number of times per `[Round]`, and Stop the Breath now affects any opponent you hit with Axe Kick, Disarm, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut, regardless of whether they successfully save against it or not.

## Disciple of the Monkey

### 1st Circle – External Techniques `EX`

Choose five weapon properties other than `[Arcane]`, `[Barbed]`, `[Distant]`, `[Hold-out]` or `[Quick-draw]`. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon’s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.

Additionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties
your Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses. You may grant it 2 such properties at 1st circle, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, and 5 at 7th. The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.

Attacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the `[Precision]` descriptor equal to your level.

### 2nd Cirle - Go to no Evil, Do no Evil

Your combat maneuvers, and opponents’ attempts to escape or act in a `[Grappled]` or `[Pinned]` condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:

#### Crippling Jabs `EX`

You target your opponent's legs with rapid successive strikes, stunting their agility and movement range. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Reflex save or take a -1 penalty to their Reflex saves for 1 `[Round]` and suffer a -5 ft penalty to their movement speed (minimum: their base movement speed) until the end of the `[Encounter]`. Every 5ft lost counts as a separate status condition for the purposes of effects that remove status conditions.

#### Disabling Jabs `EX`

You target your opponent's arms with rapid successive strikes, stunting their offensive capability and range. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty to their attack rolls for 1 `[Round]` and either  (you decide which) suffer a -5 ft penalty to their melee attack range (minimum: 5 ft) or lose the furthest range with any ranged attack (minimum: `[Close]` range). Every 5ft or range increment lost counts as a separate status condition for the purposes of effects that remove status conditions.

### 3rd Circle - See no Evil, Be no Evil

You gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques:

#### Impairing Jabs `EX`

You target your opponent's head with rapid successive strikes, stunting their concentration and vision. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Will save or take a -1 penalty to their Will saves for 1 `[Round]` and lose 1 vision mode (or have the effects of the Arcane Sight, Blindsight, See Invisibility, or True Seeing spells upon them dispelled) of their choice (minimum: normal vision or `[Blindsight]` if possessing the Justice, Blind `[Iconic]` feat) until the end of the `[Encounter]`. Each vision mode lost counts as a separate status condition for the purposes of effects that remove status conditions.

#### Debilitating Jabs `EX`

You target your opponent's core with rapid successive strikes, stunting their stamina and endurance. As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty to their Fortitude saves for 1 `[Round]` and become `[Battered]` until the end of the `[Encounter]`.

In addition, when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip, you may immediately make a `[Bonus attack]`.

### 4th Circle - Ceaseless Flow `EX`

Once per `[Round]`, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Crippling Jabs, Debilitating Jabs, Disabling Jabs, Disarm, Grapple, Impairing Jabs, Pin, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this `[Round]`. If you replace a `[Bonus attack]` using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your `[Bonus attack]` for that `[Round]`.

### 5th Circle - Stop the Breath `EX`

Your combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Crippling Jabs, Debilitating Jabs, Disabling Jabs, Disarm, Grapple, Impairing Jabs, Pin, or Trip, it is `[Flat-footed]` until the beginning of its next turn.

### 6th Circle - No Evil

Choose one of the following abilities (this choice is permanent):

#### Defeat All Evil `EX`

Your Combat Maneuvers become more devastating in ways unique to each:

* **Double Disarm:** On a failed save, Disarm additionally causes the target to drop their shield (if any).
* **Strangle:** Choke additionally causes `[Bleeding]` and `[Burning]`.
* **Roundhouse / Slide Tackle:** On a failed save, Trip instead causes `[Blown Away]`.
* **Crippling Flurry:** On a failed save, Crippling Jabs additionally causes a -1 penalty to AC for 1 `[Round]`.
* **Disabling Flurry:** On a failed save, Disabling Jabs additionally causes a -3 penalty to damage for 1 `[Round]`.
* **Impairing Flurry:** On a failed save, Impairing Jabs additionally causes a -1 penalty to both Awareness and Perception checks for 1 `[Round]`.
* **Debilitating Flurry:** On a failed save, Debilitating Jabs additionally causes a -3 penalty to `[Damage Reduction]` for 1 `[Round]`.

#### Purge All Evil `EX`
Your special Combat Maneuvers have surpassed their former limits:

* **Crippling Palms:** Crippling Jabs's minimum movement speed is now 0 ft. A creature without a movement speed cannot move or change movement modes.
* **Disabling Palms:** Disabling Jabs's minimum melee attack range is 0 ft, and it has no minimum ranged attack range. A creature without a melee attack range threatens no area and cannot use melee attacks, and a creature without a ranged attack range cannot use ranged attacks. Remember that `[Melee]` range, which is not affected by Disabling Palms's penalties to melee attack range for purposes of ranged attack range, stands between `[Close]` range and no range.
* **Impairing Palms:** Impairing Jabs's minimum vision mode count is now 0. A creature lacking any vision modes is `[Blind]`.
* **Debilitating Palms:** On a failed save, Debilitating Jabs also inflicts `[Energy-Drained]` for 1 `[Round]`.

### 7th Circle - On Power EX

You can now use Ceaseless Flow any number of times per `[Round]`, and Stop the Breath now affects any opponent you hit with Crippling Jabs, Debilitating Jabs, Disabling Jabs, Disarm, Grapple, Impairing Jabs, Pin, or Trip, regardless of whether they successfully save against it or not.

## Drunken Brawler

Some drinkers figure out how to integrate alcohol into their fighting style, though none would call it a Discipline. It can be surprisingly effective, and foes are often caught off guard by a Drunken Brawler's unexpected competence. Aside from the brute force unlocked by being drunk, these Drunken Brawlers can also manifest effects reminiscent of the various stages of drunkenness in those they manage to hit.

### Condition: `[Inebriated]`

Though you can hold your liquor well, you are undeniably drunk. Like a `[Confused]` creature, an `[Inebriated]` creature’s actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn:

|RESULT|EFFECT|
|:----:|:-----|
|1-10|Spend his standard or move action babbling incoherently|
|11-30|Have his movement speed halved for 1 `[Round]`|
|31-60|Take offensive actions against the nearest enemy, moving toward it as necessary|
|61-100|Act normally|

An `[Inebriated]` creature who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. If an opponent takes an offensive action against an `[Inebriated]` creature, that creature takes offensive actions against that opponent on its next turn, moving toward it as necessary as long as it is still `[Inebriated]` when its turn comes. If remaining in an Area of Effect would cause harm to an `[Inebriated]` creature, it attempts to leave that Area of Effect so long as this would not prevent it from taking offensive actions against an opponent that has just attempted to harm it.

An `[Inebriated]` creature does not make Attacks of Opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). Unless otherwise noted, this condition expires at the end of the `[Scene]`. Any effect that can remove the `[Confused]` condition can remove the `[Inebriated]` condition.

### Weapon Property: `[Disgusting]`
Disgusting weapons inflict `[Sickened]` on a critical hit.

### 1st Circle - Spirit Spirit `EX`

You seem like a bumbling drunkard, which has its benefits. You are `[Immune]` to the `[Confused]` condition. Also, you are `[Immune]` to the `[Nauseated]` and `[Sickened]` conditions from any source other than this track and can never become completely `[Immune]` to those conditions. In combat encounters, you are permanently `[Inebriated]`.

#### Raw Strength

Your buzzed state has stripped away all inhibitions (and eliminated any hope of concentration).

Your Unarmed Strike Natural weapon gains the `[Brutal 3]`, `[Disgusting]`, and `[Magnum]` properties. When wielding an Improvised weapon, you can grant it properties of your choice from your Unarmed Strike Natural weapon until it has 5 properties. The Improvised weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.

Your bonuses to damage from the Deadly Aim and Power Attack Combat Maneuvers and Critical hits are doubled. Also, all bonus damage from the Deadly Aim and Power Attack Combat Maneuvers and Critical hits is `[Precision]` damage. Additionally, you cannot use the Precise Strike Combat Maneuver.

Attacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional `[Precision]` damage equal to your level.

### 2nd Circle - Imbibed Insight

Your blurred vision and slurred speech belie a deepening grasp on your surroundings.  Your combat maneuvers, and opponents’ attempts to escape or act in a `[Grappled]` or `[Pinned]` condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of Raw Strength:

#### True Headbutt `EX`

As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. Before calculating `[Miss Chance]` (if any), the target must make a Reflex save or have their `[Miss Chance]` ignored.

#### Violent Gouge `EX`

As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or begin `[Bleeding]` and `[Burning]`.

### 3rd Circle - Drunken Boxing

You no longer know when to throw in the towel. You are `[Immune]` to the `[Disabled]` and `[Dying]` conditions. Additionally, you gain access to the following special Combat Maneuvers which benefit from the bonus damage from Raw Strength:

#### Drunk Fist `EX`
As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save or become `[Sickened]` for 1 `[Round]`.

#### Hangover Hook `EX`

As a standard action, you make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, you are `[Sickened]` for 1 `[Round]`. If this attack hits an opponent, the target must make a Fortitude save or become `[Sickened]`. If this attack hits an opponent who is `[Immune]` to the `[Sickened]` condition, the target must make a Fortitude save or become `[Sickened]` for 1 `[Round]`, ignoring their `[Immunity]`. If this attack hits a `[Sickened]` opponent, the target must make a Fortitude save or become `[Nauseated]`.

In addition, when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip, you may immediately make a `[Bonus attack]`.

### 4th Circle - Ceaseless Flow `EX`

Once per `[Round]`, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Axe Kick, Disarm, Flying Strike, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this `[Round]`. If you replace a `[Bonus attack]` using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your `[Bonus attack]` for that `[Round]`.

### 5th Circle - Stop the Breath `EX`

Your combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Axe Kick, Disarm, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut, it is `[Flat-footed]` until the beginning of its next turn.

### 6th Circle - Disjunction of the Alcoholic

You have learned how to dispel the magic known as sobriety. You gain access to the following special Combat Maneuver which benefits from the bonus damage of Raw Strength:

#### Temulent Slam `EX`

You make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. If this attack hits, you become `[Nauseated]`, and the target must make a Fortitude save or become both `[Battered]` and `[Inebriated]`. If the opponent fails their save, this attack doesn't qualify you as the target for the `[Inebriated]` condition's aggression rules.

### 7th Circle - On Power `EX`

You can now use Ceaseless Flow any number of times per `[Round]`, and Stop the Breath now affects any opponent you hit with Axe Kick, Disarm, Forceful Blow, Grapple, Pin, Trip, or Uppercut, regardless of whether they successfully save against it or not.

## Discipline of the Mantis

### 1st Circle – External Techniques `EX`

Choose five weapon properties other than `[Arcane]`, `[Barbed]`, `[Distant]`, `[Hold-out]` or `[Quick-draw]`. At 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, you may choose an additional weapon property. Your Unarmed Strike natural weapon gains those properties. If you possess any other natural weapons, they gain any 2 of your Unarmed Strike natural weapon’s chosen properties at 1st circle, and 1 more at 3rd, 5th and 7th circles. These choices are permanent.

Additionally, whenever you switch to a weapon, you may grant it a number of weapon properties
your Unarmed Strike natural weapon possesses. You may grant it 2 such properties at 1st circle, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, and 5 at 7th. The weapon retains those properties for as long as you wield it.

Attacks you make as part of a Disarm, Grapple, Pin, or Trip attempt deal additional damage with the `[Precision]` descriptor equal to your level.

### c2 Raptor Stance

Your combat maneuvers, and opponents’ attempts to escape or act in a `[Grappled]` or `[Pinned]` condition you inflict, have a DC of (11 + 1/2 your level + your KOM). This DC increases by 1 at 4th circle, and again at 6th circle. In addition, you gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques.

#### Repeated Strikes `EX`

You strike your opponent several times in succession, adding injury after injury. As a standard action, make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. Compare your attack roll -5 to your opponent's AC. If this would still result in a hit, you deal an additional 1d6 damage.

#### Mantis Hook `EX`

By holding your arms in an unusual configuration, you are able to use them for attack as well as defense. As a standard action, make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. You also gain a +2 Deflection bonus to AC against that foe for one round, which stacks with any other Deflection bonuses you may possess (though not with itself).

### C3 The Fist Takes Flight

You gain access to the following special combat maneuvers, which benefit from the additional damage of External Techniques.

Sweeping Strike `EX`

You have trained to face multiple foes at once, splitting your attention equally between the two. As a standard action, make a single melee attack that deals normal damage. Apply the same attack roll to another opponent within `[Melee]` range. If that attack hits, you deal normal damage to the second opponent as well.

Snap Punch `EX`

Your attacks are so rapid, opponents never see them coming. Once per `[Encounter]`, you may make a single melee attack at your highest BAB as a move action. This attack suffers a -5 penalty to hit and may not be replaced with a combat maneuver, but otherwise follows all the normal rules for attacking.

### c4 Ceaseless Flow `EX`

Once per `[Round]`, you may replace any one melee attack other than an attack of opportunity with any of the following combat maneuvers, at the same attack bonus as the replaced attack: Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pushing Blow, or Trip. If the combat maneuver hits, you can use Ceaseless Flow an additional time this `[Round]`. If you replace a `[Bonus attack]` using Ceaseless Flow, it still counts as your `[Bonus attack]` for that `[Round ]`.

### c5 Stop the Breath `EX`

Your combat maneuvers increase in potency: when an opponent fails a save against your Close Meridian, Disarm, Grapple, Neutralize, Open Gate, Pin, Pushing Blow, or Trip, it is `[Flat-footed]` until the beginning of its next turn.

### C6 Mantis Perfection

Choose one of the following abilities (this choice is permanent):

#### Perfect Striking `EX`

Repeated Strikes deals an additional 2d6 damage, rather than 1d6. Snap Punch no longer suffers a penalty on the attack roll.

#### Rapid Fists `EX`
