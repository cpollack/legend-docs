No two rogues are quite the same, and some can show quite incredible variety. Whether by nature or nurture, rogues develop a wide range of talents, though any given rogue has a preference for certain aspects of that spectrum. These unorthodox fighting styles make rogues dangerous and unpredictable opponents, and they often relish in their enemies' confusion. A rogue's vast arsenal of tricks means they can keep their enemies guessing until the final blow. Some rogues like to make elaborate plans, depending on personal skill and expertise; others play it fast and loose, relying on their luck when everything goes sour. 

# Party Role

Rogues are excellent at dealing lots of damage while remaining mobile. A rogue should always be on the lookout for her next target, and deliver devastating blows where they count most. As a class that trains many skills, rogues are versatile characters both in and out of combat. 


# Rogues in Your Game 

While it might be tempting to make all rogues some kind of thief, they can also serve as excellent scouts, pirates, musketeers, duelists, or undercover detectives. A rogue's many skills make them excellent experts of almost any profession.

## Attack and Save Progression

|Level|BAB|Good Saves|Poor Saves|
|:---:|:-:|:--------:|:--------:|

# Class Features

## Technician or Warrior
Rogues are either unsurpassed experts in skills or able combatants. At 1st level, a rogue chooses between either a Good Base Attack Bonus (equal to level) or 2 additional trained skills (bringing their base number of trained skills to 8). This choice is permanent. 

## Hardy or Resolute
In addition, rogues can choose between being slippery tricksters or hardy thugs. Choose one of Will or Fortitude; that save is a Good save for you, and the other is Poor. Reflex is always a Good save for rogues. This choice is permanent.

## Rogue Tactics
Each rogue chooses a single track's worth of offensive class features and a single track's worth of defensive class features. You choose both your offensive and defensive track at 1st level. Once made, these choices are permanent. Unless stated otherwise, rogue abilities are extraordinary and can be used at will.

The variety inherent to these tracks means that rogues vary in their Key Ability Modifiers. Your choice of offensive track determines your Key Offensive Modifier, and your choice of defensive track determines your Key Defensive Modifier. If you multiclass out of one of these tracks, you may choose any ability modifier for the KOM (for rogues without an offensive track) or KDM (for rogues without a defensive track); of course, the two modifiers must still be linked to different abilities. 

## The Gift
While rogues can choose different offensive and defensive tracks, there is a certain essence that defines a rogue. Either they are masters of their craft, or sly rogues that seem to be making it up as they go along. A rogue must choose between the Esoterica Radica and the Esoterica Adeptus. This choice is permanent. These paths are unique to Rogues and cannot be traded away via multiclassing (or accessed via multiclassing).

# The Gift

## Esoterica Radica
Some rogues are by nature gamblers, people who bet everything on chances that they can't control. Whether a rogue is crouched in an alcove hoping a guard won't glance in while passing by or setting a fuse with just enough time to sprint through a hallway, dive through a window, and land in a moat, there is always an extra variable that no rogue can control. The abilities of the Esoterica Radica let you stretch your circumstances just far enough to get past that extra variable and make a quick getaway if you still can't win.


### 1st Circle &mdash; Playing it Right `EX`

Any rogue learns to use a few key skills without pausing to think about them. Pick two skills. You can take 10 on both these skills regardless of circumstances.

### 2nd Circle &mdash; When to Hold `EX`

When it's time to stand your ground, you trust in your uncanny luck to protect you. Once per `[Encounter]` per circle you possess in this track, as an immediate action, you may gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves until the beginning of your next turn.

### 3rd Circle &mdash; When to Fold `EX`

You know the value of beating a hasty retreat in the face of danger. Once per `[Encounter]`, plus an additional usage for every 4 character levels, as a swift action, you can gain an extra move action on your current turn. If you use this move action to move, the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

### 4th Circle &mdash; When to Cheat `EX`

Once per `[Round]`, you may take an additional swift or immediate action.

### 5th Circle &mdash; When to Run `EX`

Sometimes walking away from a fight isn't fast enough. Twice per `[Encounter]`, as an immediate action, you can move up to your movement speed.

### 6th Circle &mdash; An Ace to Keep `EX`

You can be extra-lucky when you need to be. Once per `[Round]`, you may make a hit with an attack you made that is not a critical hit into a critical hit, inflicting all normal effects of a critical hit.

### 7th Circle &mdash; Gambler's Dao `EX`

You've made it this far with unbelievably good luck, so you may as well keep relying on it. Whenever you roll a d20, you instead roll two d20s and choose the better result.

## Esoterica Adeptus
Some rogues are masters of their craft, experienced in such varied fields that they always have the expertise needed at a moment's notice. Whether it's a rogue adapting to broken tools to crack a safe as a guard approaches down the hall or having stowed a tool for just such an occasion, this rogue overcomes unforeseen circumstances through sheer versatility. The abilities of the Esoterica Adeptus let you broaden your master of the world enough for you account for that last-minute snag, or at least tilt the odds in your favor if things go sour.

### Path Feature &mdash; Tricks of the Trade

Choose two skill trappings from any of the skills you are proficient in. The do not need to be from the same skill.  You have advantage when rolling these two trappings.

Additionally, you can communicate in Thieve's Cant.

### Path Feature &mdash; Dilettante Talent

When this path advances to the first circle, you may choose one of the talents listed below. For each additional circle, you may choose two additional talents. 


# Dilettante Talents

## Physical Skills

### General

### Escape Route

_'Never, ever, overstay your welcome.' - __Andromeda___

Once on your turn, before you take your Standard or Move action, you can declare that you're in too deep and need a way out.  If you do, name your escape route and roll Acrobatics or Athletics versus a DC of 20 + the highest level of the enemies present.

On a success, you're gone. At the end of the `[Round]`, you appear in a location within `[Medium]` range that you declare as part of your escape. If your escape takes you someplace further, you can appear in that location within `[Far]` at the end of the next `[Round]`.  No creature can intercept or otherwise impede you &mdash; you effectively don't exist on the battlefield until you arrive at your location.

If you fail to meet the DC you can stay or go, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.  This can be damage, hangers on, a curse thrown at you as you flee, or anything else the table deems appropriate.

### Acrobatics

### Evasion

__You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects.__ 

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Reflex saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.  

Additionally, the first time each `[Round]` you must make a Reflex save you may instead roll Acrobatics.

### Tumble

You gain advantage to disengage checks. In addition, while you are moving, if an enemy moves to intercept you, you can make one disengage roll per intercepting enemy as a free action to avoid that enemy, but you must stop the first time you fail any of those disengage checks.

### Athletics

### Transcendent Climb

With sufficient ranks in Climb, you earn the following.

* __10 Ranks:__ For surfaces requiring a DC 20 or lower to climb, you do not need to use both hands to climb.
* __15 Ranks:__ You may always move at least half your speed while climbing--meeting the DC of a surface now allows you to use your full speed.
* __20 Ranks:__ You never need to use both hands to climb, and for surfaces requiring a DC 20 or lower to climb you may actually go hands-free.
* __25 Ranks:__ You only ever need two limbs to climb.  You can run up walls, climb ropes while someone dangles from your ankles, or kick and pull your way up fortified walls using only one leg and your uninjured arm.

### Transcendent Breaking Restraints

With sufficient ranks in Athletics, you earn the following:

* __10 Ranks:__ You may increase the DC of any Breaking Restraints check by 10 to attempt the check as a Swift Action.  Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to saves versus the Grapple and Pin combat maneuvers.
* __15 Ranks:__ You may take your action over the course of a full minute (10 `[Rounds]` of Focus Actions) to reduce the DC of an Breaking Restraints check by 4.
* __20 Ranks:__ You may now roll Breaking Restraints as a Standard Action by adding 2 points to the DC of the check, instead of 5.
* __25 Ranks:__ You no longer need to increase the DC of an Breaking Restraints check to attempt it as a Standard action.  Additionally, for every 2 minutes you spend examining a restraint, you may decrease the DC needed for you to escape it by 1.

### Transcendent Swim

With sufficient ranks in Swim, you earn the following:

* __10 Ranks:__ You may always move at least 10 feet while swimming in waters with a DC of 15 or lower, even on a failure.
* __15 Ranks:__ You may always move at least half your speed while swimming &mdash; meeting the DC of a surface now allows you to use your full speed.
* __20 Ranks:__ You may, by halving your move speed while swimming, allow a number of allies who are secured to you in some way to benefit from your swim speed.  The number of allies you may assist this way is equal to your Athletics divided by 5.  You may round this number up.
* __25 Ranks:__ Nothing restricts you from Taking 10 on Swim checks.

### Larceny

### Keymaster

You have been trained as a master locksmith and lockpicker.  To a true master like you, there is no lock that can't be opened. The measure for lock's quality is simply how long it takes.

After you have failed the first check to open a specific lock, you can tell the DM you intend to put your head down and get the lock open &mdash; the DM then rolls a d6 to determine how long it takes you to open it. Usually that will be 1d6 minutes, but locks of extraordinary quality exist that take 1d6 hours or even 1d6 days. Rare locks like this protect the crown jewels of the Emperor or the Lich King's phylactery. Rumors persist of a legendary lock in the heart of Mechanus that would take even a master like you years if not centuries. It's not even about what the lock keeps safe. Maybe a mortal should never open it. It's about the challenge.

### Transcendent Escape Artist

With sufficient ranks in Larceny, you earn the following:

* __10 Ranks__: You may increase the DC of any Escape Artist check by 10 to attempt the check as a Swift Action.  Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to saves versus the Grapple and Pin combat maneuvers.
* __15 Ranks__: You may take your action over the course of a full minute (10 `[Rounds]` of Focus Actions) to reduce the DC of an Escape Artist check by 4.
* __20 Ranks__: You may now roll Escape Artist as a Standard Action by adding 2 points to the DC of the check, instead of 5.
* __25 Ranks__: You no longer need to increase the DC of an Escape Artist check to attempt it as a Standard action.  Additionally, for every 2 minutes you spend examining a restraint, you may decrease the DC needed for you to escape it by 1.

### Transcendent Sleight of Hand

With sufficient ranks in Sleight of Hand, you earn the following.

* __10 Ranks:__ You may roll Sleight of Hand check against a creature in `[Melee]` as part of a Move Action.  On a success, your opponent has Disadvantage on saves versus you Disarm and Trip combat maneuvers for one `[Round]`.
* __15 Ranks:__ You may now attempt a Sleight of Hand check as part of a Move Action by increasing the DC of the check by 5.
* __20 Ranks:__ You may not attempt a Sleight of Hand check as part of a Swift Action by increasing the DC of the check by 5, or as part of a Move Action without penalty.  Using the normal Standard action grants you a +2 bonus to your check.
* __25 Ranks:__ Picking up an item in your `[Melee]` range is a free action, and all weapons you wield have the `[Quick-draw]` property.

### Practiced Burglar / Saboteur 

You may increase the DC of a Burglary or Disable Device check by 5 to reduce the amount of time it would take to finish by one step: 

* 2d4 rounds
* 1d4 rounds
* A focus action
* A standard action
* A move action
* A swift action.

### Deep Pockets

You habitually help yourself to the carried possessions of others, to the point where you find items in your pockets where you don't remember how they got there. 

Whenever you take a moment to check your numerous pockets and hiding places for something that might be useful, roll a 1d20 with no modifier.

On a 15+, you pull a helpful item out of your pockets, which could be a clue to a riddle, the key to a lock or a jewel when you are short on cash.

On a 8+, you still find a useful item, but there is a complication. The item could be cursed, the owner could be looking for it, or you learn a secret that is very dangerous to know.

### Stealth

### Perfect Sneak

You have perfected the art of moving without making a sound.

You always get a surprise round against opponents when your initiative roll is even.  Additionally, you gain a +2 to all Stealth rolls.

### Transcendent Stealth

With sufficient ranks in Stealth, you earn the following.

* __10 Ranks__: Reduce the Stealth penalty from sniping by 10.
* __15 Ranks__: Stealth check penalties for moving quickly are halved, including the ability unlocked at 10 Ranks, moving full speed, and reaching concealment after creating a distraction.
* __20 Ranks__: If you attack after successfully using Stealth, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus against all attacks that you make before the end of your turn.
* __25 Ranks__: If you attack after successfully using Stealth, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus against all attacks that you make before the beginning of your next turn.
