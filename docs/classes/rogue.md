No two rogues are quite the same, and some can show quite incredible variety. Whether by nature or nurture, rogues develop a wide range of talents, though any given rogue has a preference for certain aspects of that spectrum. These unorthodox fighting styles make rogues dangerous and unpredictable opponents, and they often relish in their enemies' confusion. A rogue's vast arsenal of tricks means they can keep their enemies guessing until the final blow. Some rogues like to make elaborate plans, depending on personal skill and expertise; others play it fast and loose, relying on their luck when everything goes sour. 

# Party Role

Rogues are excellent at dealing lots of damage while remaining mobile. A rogue should always be on the lookout for her next target, and deliver devastating blows where they count most. As a class that trains many skills, rogues are versatile characters both in and out of combat. 


# Rogues in Your Game 

While it might be tempting to make all rogues some kind of thief, they can also serve as excellent scouts, pirates, musketeers, duelists, or undercover detectives. A rogue's many skills make them excellent experts of almost any profession.

# Class Features

## Technician or Warrior
Rogues are either unsurpassed experts in skills or able combatants. At 1st level, a rogue chooses between either a Good Base Attack Bonus (equal to level) or 2 additional trained skills (bringing their base number of trained skills to 8). This choice is permanent. 

## Hardy or Resolute
In addition, rogues can choose between being slippery tricksters or hardy thugs. Choose one of Will or Fortitude; that save is a Good save for you, and the other is Poor. Reflex is always a Good save for rogues. This choice is permanent.

## Rogue Tactics
Each rogue chooses a single track's worth of offensive class features and a single track's worth of defensive class features. You choose both your offensive and defensive track at 1st level. Once made, these choices are permanent. Unless stated otherwise, rogue abilities are extraordinary and can be used at will.

The variety inherent to these tracks means that rogues vary in their Key Ability Modifiers. Your choice of offensive track determines your Key Offensive Modifier, and your choice of defensive track determines your Key Defensive Modifier. If you multiclass out of one of these tracks, you may choose any ability modifier for the KOM (for rogues without an offensive track) or KDM (for rogues without a defensive track); of course, the two modifiers must still be linked to different abilities. 

## The Gift
While rogues can choose different offensive and defensive tracks, there is a certain essence that defines a rogue. Either they are masters of their craft, or sly rogues that seem to be making it up as they go along. A rogue must choose between the Esoterica Radica and the Esoterica Adeptus. This choice is permanent. These paths are unique to Rogues and cannot be traded away via multiclassing (or accessed via multiclassing).

# The Gift

## Esoterica Radica
Some rogues are by nature gamblers, people who bet everything on chances that they can't control. Whether a rogue is crouched in an alcove hoping a guard won't glance in while passing by or setting a fuse with just enough time to sprint through a hallway, dive through a window, and land in a moat, there is always an extra variable that no rogue can control. The abilities of the Esoterica Radica let you stretch your circumstances just far enough to get past that extra variable and make a quick getaway if you still can't win.

## Esoterica Adeptus
Some rogues are masters of their craft, experienced in such varied fields that they always have the expertise needed at a moment's notice. Whether it's a rogue adapting to broken tools to crack a safe as a guard approaches down the hall or having stowed a tool for just such an occasion, this rogue overcomes unforeseen circumstances through sheer versatility. The abilities of the Esoterica Adeptus let you broaden your master of the world enough for you account for that last-minute snag, or at least tilt the odds in your favor if things go sour.
