No two rogues are quite the same, and some can show quite incredible variety. Whether by nature or nurture, rogues develop a wide range of talents, though any given rogue has a preference for certain aspects of that spectrum. These unorthodox fighting styles make rogues dangerous and unpredictable opponents, and they often relish in their enemies' confusion. A rogue's vast arsenal of tricks means they can keep their enemies guessing until the final blow. Some rogues like to make elaborate plans, depending on personal skill and expertise; others play it fast and loose, relying on their luck when everything goes sour. 

# Party Role

Rogues are excellent at dealing lots of damage while remaining mobile. A rogue should always be on the lookout for her next target, and deliver devastating blows where they count most. As a class that trains many skills, rogues are versatile characters both in and out of combat. 


# Rogues in Your Game 

While it might be tempting to make all rogues some kind of thief, they can also serve as excellent scouts, pirates, musketeers, duelists, or undercover detectives. A rogue's many skills make them excellent experts of almost any profession.

# Class Features

### Technician or Warrior
Rogues are either unsurpassed experts in skills or able combatants. At 1st level, a rogue chooses between either a Good Base Attack Bonus (equal to level) or 2 additional trained skills (bringing their base number of trained skills to 8). This choice is permanent. 

### Hardy or Resolute
In addition, rogues can choose between being slippery tricksters or hardy thugs. Choose one of Will or Fortitude; that save is a Good save for you, and the other is Poor. Reflex is always a Good save for rogues. This choice is permanent.

### Rogue Tactics
Each rogue chooses a single track's worth of offensive class features and a single track's worth of defensive class features. You choose both your offensive and defensive track at 1st level. Once made, these choices are permanent. Unless stated otherwise, rogue abilities are extraordinary and can be used at will.

The variety inherent to these tracks means that rogues vary in their Key Ability Modifiers. Your choice of offensive track determines your Key Offensive Modifier, and your choice of defensive track determines your Key Defensive Modifier. If you multiclass out of one of these tracks, you may choose any ability modifier for the KOM (for rogues without an offensive track) or KDM (for rogues without a defensive track); of course, the two modifiers must still be linked to different abilities. 

### The Gift
While rogues can choose different offensive and defensive tracks, there is a certain essence that defines a rogue. Either they are masters of their craft, or sly rogues that seem to be making it up as they go along. A rogue must choose between the Esoterica Radica and the Esoterica Adeptus. This choice is permanent. These paths are unique to Rogues and cannot be traded away via multiclassing (or accessed via multiclassing).

# Offensive Track
Pick one of the following tracks. You gain the abilities of your chosen track in order, at the level shown in the table for your class.

## Assassin

Rogues who choose the Assassin track focus on their ability to set up devastating strikes from cover or stealth. Eventually, they learn to destroy crowds just as efficiently as they would eliminate a lone guardsman. Your Key Offensive Modifier is Dexterity, as appropriate for a stealthy character.

### 1st Circle &mdash; Sneak Attack `EX`
You know that a fair fight is a failure to plan. Any time you make an attack that hits a `[Flat-footed]`, `[Helpless]`, `[Confused]`, `[Dazed]`, `[Entangled]`, `[Exhausted]`, `[Stunned]`, `[Shaken]`, `[Frightened]`, `[Cowering]` or `[Panicked]` target, you deal 1d6 additional damage with the `[Precision]` descriptor per Assassin circle that you possess, to a maximum of 7d6.

### 2nd Circle &mdash; Slayer's Sense `EX`
Once you go for an enemy, you're rarely inclined to let them escape alive. You can ignore `[Concealed]` and `[Fully concealed]` when attacking an opponent you have previously damaged with Sneak Attack during the `[Encounter]`.

### 3rd Circle &mdash; Blood Calls to Blade `EX`
Any time you make an attack against an opponent subject to your Sneak Attack ability while you are not benefiting from fury bonuses to attack rolls, save DCs, or damage, you gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll.

### 4th Circle &mdash; Menacing Presence `EX`
The sight of one of your victims leaves their allies disturbed and vulnerable. Whenever an opponent ends its turn within your `[Melee]` range of another creature you have damaged with a Sneak Attack during this `[Encounter]`, it becomes `[Shaken]` for one `[Round]`. This is a `[Mind-affecting]`, `[Fear]` effect.

### 5th Circle &mdash; Felling Strike `EX`
The shock of a Sneak Attack often causes an enemy to open their defenses. Whenever you deal additional damage with the `[Precision]` descriptor to an opponent within `[Melee]` range with your Sneak Attack ability, that opponent is knocked `[Prone]`. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the `[Prone]` condition.

### 6th Circle &mdash; Battle Fatigue `EX`
Even if an enemy survives your first strikes, you still leave their body battered and crippled. If you deal Sneak Attack damage to an opponent twice in the same `[Round]`, that opponent is `[Slowed]` until the beginning of your next turn.

### 7th Circle &mdash; No Exit `EX`
Hell is one other person in particular &mdash; you. Twice per `[Encounter]`, as a swift action, you may deal additional damage equal to 5x your level on your next Sneak Attack this `[Round]`, and cause the target to be `[Blinded]` and `[Stunned]` for one `[Round]`. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) halves the additional damage and causes the opponent to become `[Dazzled]` and `[Entangled]`, instead of being `[Stunned]` and `[Blinded]`. This is a `[Death]` effect.


## Swashbuckler

Rogues who choose the Swashbuckler track focus on elegant, mobile combat, preferably one-on-one so that they can isolate an opponent and show off properly. Your Key Offensive Modifier is Dexterity, since you value quick mobility and finesse.

### 1st Circle &mdash; Dance With Me `EX`
Whenever you move at least 10 ft, your next attack this `[Round]` deals additional damage with the `[Precision]` descriptor equal to your KDM plus your character level.

### 2nd Circle &mdash; Once More! `EX`
When you spend a standard action to make a single attack that is not part of a spell-like ability or spell, and then move at least 10 ft during the same `[Round]`, you may make a single melee attack at the end of your movement. This attack, called a `Once More!` attack, can be made another time at the end of each additional instance of movement after moving at least 10 more ft. The required distance may comprise a single movement or multiple movements (such as a pair of 5 ft steps), but a `Once More!` attack can only be made when a movement ends. If the movement is made as part of an action, you can likewise only activate `Once More!` at the end of that action. At 2nd circle you may only make one `Once More!` attack per `[Round]`. This expands to two Once More! attacks per `[Round]` at 4th circle, and three Once More! attacks per `[Round]` at 6th circle.

### 3rd Circle &mdash; Dirty Fighting `EX`
Your speed and finesse leave opponents demoralized and bruised, even before they are defeated. The first time you hit any opponent with a `Once More!` attack this `[Round]`, your opponent becomes `[Battered]` for two `[Rounds]`. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the `[Battered]` condition.

### 4th Circle &mdash; Kick Him While He's Down `EX` 
Once you begin to throw down, you have a knack of taking the advantage and running with it. Once per `[Round]`, after making an attack during your turn, you may immediately take two free 5 ft steps (even if you used or will use a move action to move) and make a `[Bonus attack]`.

### 5th Circle &mdash; Concussive Impact `EX`
You disorient your opponents with lightning-fast strikes. If you hit an opponent with two `Once More!` attacks in the same `[Round]`, they become `[Confused]` for one `[Round]`.

### 6th Circle &mdash; Panache `EX`
You mercilessly take advantage of openings in your opponents' defenses. Any time an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you may move 10 ft in any direction before making your attack of opportunity. In addition, every time you hit an opponent with a `Once More!` attack, you may move the target 10 ft in any direction. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

### 7th Circle &mdash; Topsy Turvy `EX`
Sometimes you roll with the punches and sometimes the punches roll with you. Your Panache ability may now move each opponent within your `[Melee]` range after you hit an opponent with a `Once More!` attack instead of just the opponent hit. Once per `[Round]` for each opponent moved, if your opponent is adjacent to an obstacle or occupied square and you are able to push them 5 ft or further, you may forgo any further movement from that activation of Panache to render that opponent `[Prone]`. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your KOM) negates the `[Prone]` condition.

# The Gift

## Esoterica Radica
Some rogues are by nature gamblers, people who bet everything on chances that they can't control. Whether a rogue is crouched in an alcove hoping a guard won't glance in while passing by or setting a fuse with just enough time to sprint through a hallway, dive through a window, and land in a moat, there is always an extra variable that no rogue can control. The abilities of the Esoterica Radica let you stretch your circumstances just far enough to get past that extra variable and make a quick getaway if you still can't win.


### 1st Circle &mdash; Playing it Right `EX`
Any rogue learns to use a few key skills without pausing to think about them. Pick two skills. You can take 10 on both these skills regardless of circumstances.

### 2nd Circle &mdash; When to Hold `EX`
When it's time to stand your ground, you trust in your uncanny luck to protect you. Once per `[Encounter]` per circle you possess in this track, as an immediate action, you may gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves until the beginning of your next turn.

### 3rd Circle &mdash; When to Fold `EX`
You know the value of beating a hasty retreat in the face of danger. Once per `[Encounter]`, plus an additional usage for every 4 character levels, as a swift action, you can gain an extra move action on your current turn. If you use this move action to move, the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

### 4th Circle &mdash; When to Cheat `EX`
Once per `[Round]`, you may take an additional swift or immediate action.

### 5th Circle &mdash; When to Run `EX`
Sometimes walking away from a fight isn't fast enough. Twice per `[Encounter]`, as an immediate action, you can move up to your movement speed.

### 6th Circle &mdash; An Ace to Keep `EX`
You can be extra-lucky when you need to be. Once per `[Round]`, you may make a hit with an attack you made that is not a critical hit into a critical hit, inflicting all normal effects of a critical hit.

### 7th Circle &mdash; Gambler's Dao `EX`
You've made it this far with unbelievably good luck, so you may as well keep relying on it. Whenever you roll a d20, you instead roll two d20s and choose the better result.

## Esoterica Adeptus
Some rogues are masters of their craft, experienced in such varied fields that they always have the expertise needed at a moment's notice. Whether it's a rogue adapting to broken tools to crack a safe as a guard approaches down the hall or having stowed a tool for just such an occasion, this rogue overcomes unforeseen circumstances through sheer versatility. The abilities of the Esoterica Adeptus let you broaden your master of the world enough for you account for that last-minute snag, or at least tilt the odds in your favor if things go sour.

### Path Feature &mdash; Tricks of the Trade
Choose two skill trappings from any of the skills you are proficient in. The do not need to be from the same skill.  You have advantage when rolling these two trappings.

Additionally, you can communicate in Thieves' Cant.

### Path Feature &mdash; Dilettante Talent
Choose one of the talents listed below. You gain new abilities at the level shown in the table for your class. For each additional circle, you may choose two additional talents.

# Dilettante Talents

## Physical Skills

### General

### Escape Route
_'Never, ever, overstay your welcome.' - __Andromeda___

Once on your turn, before you take your Standard or Move action, you can declare that you're in too deep and need a way out.  If you do, name your escape route and roll Acrobatics or Athletics versus a DC of 20 + the highest level of the enemies present.

On a success, you're gone. At the end of the `[Round]`, you appear in a location within `[Medium]` range that you declare as part of your escape. If your escape takes you someplace further, you can appear in that location within `[Far]` at the end of the next `[Round]`.  No creature can intercept or otherwise impede you &mdash; you effectively don't exist on the battlefield until you arrive at your location.

If you fail to meet the DC you can stay or go, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.  This can be damage, hangers on, a curse thrown at you as you flee, or anything else the table deems appropriate.

### Acrobatics

### Evasion
_You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects._

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Reflex saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

Additionally, the first time each `[Round]` you must make a Reflex save you may instead roll Acrobatics.

### Tumble
You gain advantage to disengage checks. In addition, while you are moving, if an enemy moves to intercept you, you can make one disengage roll per intercepting enemy as a free action to avoid that enemy, but you must stop the first time you fail any of those disengage checks.

### Athletics

* __10 Ranks:__ For surfaces requiring a DC 20 or lower to climb, you do not need to use both hands to climb.

### Larceny

### Keymaster
_You have been trained as a master locksmith and lockpicker.  To a true master like you, there is no lock that can't be opened. The measure for lock's quality is simply how long it takes._

After you have failed the first check to open a specific lock, you can tell the DM you intend to put your head down and get the lock open &mdash; the DM then rolls a d6 to determine how long it takes you to open it. Usually that will be 1d6 minutes, but locks of extraordinary quality exist that take 1d6 hours or even 1d6 days. Rare locks like this protect the crown jewels of the Emperor or the Lich King's phylactery. Rumors persist of a legendary lock in the heart of Mechanus that would take even a master like you years if not centuries. It's not even about what the lock keeps safe. Maybe a mortal should never open it. It's about the challenge.

### Transcendent Escape Artist

* __20 Ranks:__ You may not attempt a Sleight of Hand check as part of a Swift Action by increasing the DC of the check by 5, or as part of a Move Action without penalty.  Using the normal Standard action grants you a +2 bonus to your check.
* __25 Ranks:__ Picking up an item in your `[Melee]` range is a free action, and all weapons you wield have the `[Quick-draw]` property.

### Practiced Burglar / Saboteur 
You may increase the DC of a Burglary or Disable Device check by 5 to reduce the amount of time it would take to finish by one step: 

* 2d4 rounds

* On a 15+, you pull a helpful item out of your pockets, which could be a clue to a riddle, the key to a lock or a jewel when you are short on cash.

A creature that saves against your suggestion is immune to further uses of this effect for 24 hours, and whenever the suggested creature is specifically confronted with proof of your manipulation, it receives another saving throw. This is an extraordinary mind-affecting compulsion.

### Perception

### 'Security' Expert
When you spend a moment to survey a dangerous area (even while moving), roll a perception check.

* On a Success, hold 3.
* On an Hit, hold 1.

Spend your hold as you walk through the area to ask these questions:

* Is there a trap here and if so, what activates it?
* What does the trap do when activated?
* What else is hidden here?

### Danger Sense

The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).
