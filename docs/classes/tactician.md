## Spellcasting
You cast spells drawn from the tactician spell list. Your Intelligence modifier is your Spellcasting Ability Modifier (SAM) for this track. The DC for your spells is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Spellcasting Ability Modifier. You can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level in a [Scene], as noted in the table below. You also receive bonus spells per [Scene] for having a high Spellcasting Ability Modifier.

You can only cast spells that you know. You gain an additional three spells known every time you gain a circle in this track. Any time that you level up, you can unlearn a single spell and learn a new spell of the same level. You cannot learn spells of a level you cannot cast. You may use an available spell slot of a circle to cast any spell you know of that circle or lower.
